For the given code snippet, associated test inputs and plan, give the code coverage that follows the plan. The code coverage indicates whether a statement has been executed or not. 
> if the line is executed
! if the line is not executed
Example output:
> line1
! line2
> line3
...
> linen
If the test case raises an exception, provide the runtime exception raised. 
You need to develop a plan for step by step execution of the code snippet. 
Below is an illustration of the process you need to follow to predict the code coverage of the given code snippet, associated test inputs and its plan. 
Test Case : 
numDivisions = 1
numerator = 8
denominator = 0
Given Java Program : 
public class NumberDivision {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number of divisions: ");
        int numDivisions = scanner.nextInt();
        for (int i = 1; i <= numDivisions; i++) {
            int numerator = scanner.nextInt();
            int denominator = scanner.nextInt();
            if (numerator == 0) {
                System.out.println("Numerator is zero");
            }
            else {
                System.out.println("Numerator is non zero");
            }
            int result = divideNumbers(numerator, denominator);
            System.out.println("Result for division " + (i + 1) + ": " + result);
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
    private static int divideNumbers(int numerator, int denominator) {
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
}
give the PLAN for step by step execution of the given java program and tets case-
1. Import statements : Import statements are always executed. Statement "import java.util.Scanner;" will be covered. 
2. NumberDivision Class Declaration : always executed. Statement "public class Main {" is covered. 
3. Main method decalarion : always executed. Statement "public static void main(String[] args) {" is covered.
4. User Input and Program Output : always executed. Statements "Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);", "System.out.print("Enter the number of divisions: ");", "int numDivisions = scanner.nextInt();" are covered. 
5. For loop Execution : Since numDivisions is 2, the for loop condition (i <= numDivisions) is true, and the loop block will be executed. Statement "for (int i = 1; i <= numDivisions; i++) {" will be covered. 
6. For loop contents : user input statements are always executed. Statements "int numerator = scanner.nextInt();" and "int denominator = scanner.nextInt();" will be executed. 
7. If - Else condition : Since the numerator is not zero, the if condition 'numerator == 0' is not satisfies. Statement 'if (numerator == 0) {' is covered but statement 'System.out.println("Numerator is zero");' is not covered. The else condition is satisfied so statements 'else {' and "System.out.println("Numerator is non zero");" are covered. 
8. Function call within main method : The function divideNumbers will executed only if the value returned by the function is valid. 
9. divideNumbers method Declaration and Execution : method declaration is always executed. "private static int divideNumbers(int numerator, int denominator) {" is covered. But, since the value of denominator is 0, there is a DivideByZero exception handled dies to which statement "return numerator / denominator;" isn't covered. 
10. divideNumbers Method call in Main method : since value returned by divideNumbers is invalid, Statements "int result = divideNumbers(numerator, denominator);" and "System.out.println("Result for division " + (i + 1) + ": " + result);" are not covered. 
11. Statements after for loop in Main method : no statements after the for loop will be executed since the for loop failed to complete execution due to an exception raised. Statement "scanner.close();" isn't covered. 
12. Closing Brackets : always covered. 
Final code coverage of the Java program based on its test case and given step by step reasoning for execution is : 
> public class NumberDivision {
>     public static void main(String[] args) {
>         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
>         System.out.print("Enter the number of divisions: ");
>         int numDivisions = scanner.nextInt();
>         for (int i = 1; i <= numDivisions; i++) {
>             int numerator = scanner.nextInt();
>             int denominator = scanner.nextInt();
>             if (numerator == 0) {
!                 System.out.println("Numerator is zero");
>             }
>             else {
>                 System.out.println("Numerator is non zero");
>             }
!             int result = divideNumbers(numerator, denominator);
!             System.out.println("Result for division " + (i + 1) + ": " + result);
>         }
>         scanner.close();
>     }
>     private static int divideNumbers(int numerator, int denominator) {
!         return numerator / denominator;
>     }
> }
OUTPUT : 
Error : Arithemetic Exception = Division by zero
In a similar fashion, develop a plan of step by step execution of the below code snippet and predict the code coverage -

JAVA PROGRAM:

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        long[] arr = new long[5];
        long min = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
            min = Math.min(arr[i], min);
        }
        long ans = n / min + 5;
        System.out.println(ans);
