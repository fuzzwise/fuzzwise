User Input and Array Initialization: The statement \"Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\" is covered, as it initializes the scanner object. The statement \"int N = sc.nextInt();\" is covered, as it takes user input for the size of the array. The statement \"int[] A = new int[N];\" is covered, as it initializes the array with the given size.\n\n4.

Closing Brackets : always covered.\n\nFinal code coverage of the Java program based on its test case and given step by step reasoning for execution is : \n\n> import java.util.*;\n> public class Main {\n>     public static void main(String[] args) {\n>         Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n>         int N = sc.nextInt();\n>         int[] A = new int[N];\n>         for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n>             A[i] = sc.nextInt();\n>         }\n>         int[][] dp = new int[8000+5][80+5];\n>         for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++ ) {\n>             for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++) {\n>                 dp[i][j] = -1;\n>             }\n>         }\n>         dp[1000][0] = 0;\n>         for (int j = 0; j < dp[0].length; j++ ) {\n>             for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) {\n>                 if (dp[i][j] == -1 || j >= N) continue;\n>                 int price = A[j];\n>                 int num = i/price;\n>                 int remain = i - num*price;\n>                 if (num > 0) {\n>                     dp[remain][j+1] = Math.max(dp[remain][j+1], dp[i][j]+num);\n>                 }\n>                 if (dp[i][j] > 0) {\n>                     remain = i + dp[i][j]*price;\n>                     dp[remain][j+1] = Math.max(dp[remain][j+1], 0);\n>                 }\n>                 dp[i][j+1] = Math.max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i][j]);\n>             }\n>         }\n>         int ans = -1;\n>         for (int i = 0; i < dp.length; i++) {\n>             if (dp[i][N] == -1) continue;\n>             ans = i;\n>         }\n>         System.out.println(ans);\n>     }\n> }",
