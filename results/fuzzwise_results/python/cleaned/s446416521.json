The rest of the code is executed as expected. No exceptions are raised during the execution of this test case.",

            "covered_code": "To determine the code coverage of the given Python program based on the provided test case input, we need to follow a step-by-step plan for the execution of the code. The test case input is `0 0`, which means `n=0` and `m=0`. Let's go through the plan:\n\n### Execution Plan\n\n1. **Function Definition and Import Statements**:\n    - Since there are no import statements in this snippet, we start with the function definition.\n    - The function `sol()` is always executed if the script is run.\n\n2. **Input Handling**:\n    - `n, m = map(int, input().split())`: The input is `0 0`, so `n=0` and `m=0`.\n    - The dictionary `w` and sets `p`, `q` are initialized as empty.\n\n3. **For Loop (Reading `m` Lines)**:\n    - `for i in range(m)`: Since `m=0`, the loop does not execute. The body of the loop is not covered.\n\n4. **Set Operations**:\n    - `s = p - q`: Since both `p` and `q` are empty, `s` is also an empty set.\n    - `for i in s`: Since `s` is empty, this loop does not execute. The body of the loop is not covered.\n\n5. **Final Print Statement**:\n    - `print(\"Yes\" if len(s) or m == 0 else \"No\")`: Since `m=0`, the condition `m == 0` is `True`, so it prints `Yes`.\n\n6. **Main Guard**:\n    - The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` condition is always executed if the script is run directly.\n    - The call to `sol()` will be executed.\n\n### Code Coverage\n\nBased on the above plan, let's mark the coverage of each line in the original Python code snippet.\n\n```python\ndef sol():\n>    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n>    w = {}\n>    p, q = set(), set()\n!    for i in range(m):\n!        l, r, d = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n!        if l in w:\n!            w[l].add((r, d))\n!        else:\n!            w[l] = {(r, d)}\n!        p.add(l)\n!        q.add(r)\n>    s = p - q\n!    for i in s:\n!        k = {j for j in w[i]}\n!        g = set()\n!        cnt = 0\n!        while len(k):\n!            x = k.pop()\n!            cnt += 1\n!            if cnt == 5000:\n!                print(p[100])\n!            if x[0] not in w:\n!                g.add(x)\n!            else:\n!                for j in w[x[0]]:\n!                    k.add((j[0], j[1] + x[1]))\n!        y = set()\n!        for j in g:\n!            if j[0] in y or j[0] == i:\n!                print(\"No\")\n!                exit()\n!            else:\n!                y.add(j[0])\n>    print(\"Yes\" if len(s) or m == 0 else \"No\")\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>    sol()\n```\n\n### Final Output\n\n```plaintext\n> def sol():\n>    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n>    w = {}\n>    p, q = set(), set()\n!    for i in range(m):\n!        l, r, d = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n!        if l in w:\n!            w[l].add((r, d))\n!        else:\n!            w[l] = {(r, d)}\n!        p.add(l)\n!        q.add(r)\n>    s = p - q\n!    for i in s:\n!        k = {j for j in w[i]}\n!        g = set()\n!        cnt = 0\n!        while len(k):\n!            x = k.pop()\n!            cnt += 1\n!            if cnt == 5000:\n!                print(p[100])\n!            if x[0] not in w:\n!                g.add(x)\n!            else:\n!                for j in w[x[0]]:\n!                    k.add((j[0], j[1] + x[1]))\n!        y = set()\n!        for j in g:\n!            if j[0] in y or j[0] == i:\n!                print(\"No\")\n!                exit()\n!            else:\n!                y.add(j[0])\n>    print(\"Yes\" if len(s) or m == 0 else \"No\")\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>    sol()\n```\n\n### Runtime Exception\n\nNo runtime exception is raised for the test case `0 0`.
