            "covered_code": "### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution of the Given Python Program and Test Case:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: Import statements are always executed. Statements from `import sys, re, os` to `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)` will be covered.\n2. **Constants Definitions**: Constants like `INF` and `mod` are always defined. Statements `INF = float('inf')` and `mod = 10 ** 9 + 7` will be covered.\n3. **main() Function Declaration**: The declaration of the `main()` function is always executed. Statement `def main():` is covered.\n4. **Reading Input in main()**: Statements `N, M = MAP()` and `m = N` are always executed. Given the input `2 2`, `N` will be `2` and `M` will be `2`.\n5. **List Initialization in main()**: Statement `l = [10] * N` is executed and sets `l` to `[10, 10]`.\n6. **For Loop Execution**: The for loop `for i in range(M)` will iterate `2` times since `M` is `2`. Statements `s, c = MAP()` will be executed twice with inputs `1 1` and `2 2`, respectively.\n7. **First Iteration of For Loop**:\n   - Statements `if l[s-1] == 10:` and `l[s-1] = c` are executed. `l` becomes `[1, 10]` and `m` becomes `0`.\n8. **Second Iteration of For Loop**:\n   - Statements `if l[s-1] == 10:` and `l[s-1] = c` are executed. `l` becomes `[1, 2]`.\n9. **Post For Loop Execution**: Execution proceeds to check `if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:`.\n   - Given `N` is `2`, this condition is `False`, so the subsequent `print(0)` and `sys.exit()` statements are not executed.\n10. **Answer Calculation**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `\"\"`. Since `not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0` is `False`, the `ans += \"1\"` statement is not executed.\n11. **Appending to Answer**: The loop `for i in range(N-m):` runs for `2` iterations. Statements `ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)` are executed twice, making `ans` become `\"12\"`.\n12. **Printing Answer**: The first print statement `print(ans)` is executed, printing `\"12\"`.\n13. **Final For Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(N-m):` runs for `2` iterations.\n    - In the first iteration, `if not int(ans[i]) == 0:` is `True` (since `1` is not `0`), so `flag` is set to `True`.\n    - In the second iteration, `if not int(ans[i]) == 0:` is `True` (since `2` is not `0`), so no further action is taken.\n14. **Final Print Statement**: The second print statement `print(ans)` is executed, printing `\"12\"` again.\n15. **Main Function Call**: The call `if __name__ == '__main__': main()` is executed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage Based on the Given Test Case and Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n```plaintext\n> import sys, re, os\n> from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter\n> from math import ceil, sqrt, hypot, factorial, pi, sin, cos, radians\n> from itertools import permutations, combinations, product, accumulate\n> from operator import itemgetter, mul\n> from copy import deepcopy\n> from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits\n> from functools import reduce\n> from bisect import bisect_left, insort_left\n> from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop\n> INPUT = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n> INT = lambda: int(INPUT())\n> MAP = lambda: map(int, INPUT().split())\n> S_MAP = lambda: map(str, INPUT().split())\n> LIST = lambda: list(map(int, INPUT().split()))\n> S_LIST = lambda: list(map(str, INPUT().split()))\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)\n> INF = float('inf')\n> mod = 10 ** 9 + 7\n> def main():\n>     N, M = MAP()\n>     m = N\n>     l = [10] * N\n>     for i in range(M):\n>         s, c = MAP()\n>         if l[s-1] == 10:\n>             l[s-1] = c\n>             m = s - 1 if s-1 < m else m\n>         else:\n!             if c != l[s-1]:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 sys.exit()\n>     if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:\n!         print(0)\n!         sys.exit()\n>     ans = \"\"\n!     if not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0: ans += \"1\"\n>     for i in range(N-m):\n>         ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)\n>     print(ans)\n>     flag = False\n>     for i in range(N-m):\n>         if not int(ans[i]) == 0:\n>             flag = True\n>         if not flag and int(ans[i]) == 0:\n!             print(-1)\n!             sys.exit()\n>     print(ans)\n> if __name__ == '__main__':\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```\n12\n12\n```",

The program will exit here.\n   - The subsequent code after this condition will not be executed.\n\n8. **Closing Statements**: The statements after the loop and conditions will not be executed due to the program exit.\n\n**Code Coverage of the Given Python Program Based on the Test Case**\n\n```python\n> import sys, re, os\n> from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter\n> from math import ceil, sqrt, hypot, factorial, pi, sin, cos, radians\n> from itertools import permutations, combinations, product, accumulate\n> from operator import itemgetter, mul\n> from copy import deepcopy\n> from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits\n> from functools import reduce\n> from bisect import bisect_left, insort_left\n> from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop\n> INPUT = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n> INT = lambda: int(INPUT())\n> MAP = lambda: map(int, INPUT().split())\n> S_MAP = lambda: map(str, INPUT().split())\n> LIST = lambda: list(map(int, INPUT().split()))\n> S_LIST = lambda: list(map(str, INPUT().split()))\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)\n> INF = float('inf')\n> mod = 10 ** 9 + 7\n> def main():\n>     N, M = MAP()\n>     m = N\n>     l = [10] * N\n>     for i in range(M):\n>         s, c = MAP()\n>         if l[s-1] == 10:\n>             l[s-1] = c\n>             m = s - 1 if s-1 < m else m\n!         else:\n!             if c != l[s-1]:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 sys.exit()\n>     if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:\n>         print(0)\n>         sys.exit()\n!     ans = \"\"\n!     if not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0: ans += \"1\"\n!     for i in range(N-m):\n!         ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)\n!     print(ans)\n!     flag = False\n!     for i in range(N-m):\n!         if not int(ans[i]) == 0:\n!             flag = True\n!         if not flag and int(ans[i]) == 0:\n!             print(-1)\n!             sys.exit()\n!     print(ans)\n> if __name__ == '__main__':\n>     main()\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n0\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- The program reads the input, initializes variables, and processes the loop.\n- The condition `if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:` is met, the program prints `0` and exits.\n- Hence, many parts of the code after this condition are not executed.",

            "covered_code": "To predict the code coverage of the given Python program based on the provided test case, let's follow a step-by-step execution plan and indicate which lines are executed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution Plan:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: Import statements are always executed. All import statements are covered.\n2. **Lambda Functions and Constants**: The lambda functions and constants defined before the main function are always executed as part of the module loading. All lambda functions and constants are covered.\n3. **Main Function Definition**: The main function definition is always executed. The statement `def main():` is covered.\n4. **Reading Input Values**: The main function begins by reading the values of `N` and `M` using the `MAP()` function. The statements `N, M = MAP()` and `m = N` are covered.\n5. **List Initialization**: The list `l` is initialized with `10` repeated `N` times. The statement `l = [10] * N` is covered.\n6. **For Loop Execution**: The for loop will execute `M` times. Since `M` is 2 in this test case, the loop will execute twice. The statement `for i in range(M):` is covered.\n7. **First Iteration of For Loop**:\n    - Read values `s` and `c` using `MAP()`. The statement `s, c = MAP()` is covered.\n    - Since `l[s-1]` is `10`, the condition `if l[s-1] == 10:` is true, and `l[s-1] = c` and `m = s - 1 if s-1 < m else m` statements are executed. The `else` block is not executed. \n8. **Second Iteration of For Loop**:\n    - Read values `s` and `c` again using `MAP()`. The statement `s, c = MAP()` is covered.\n    - Since `l[s-1]` is not `10` this time, the `else` block is executed. The condition `if c != l[s-1]:` is checked and since `c` is equal to `l[s-1]`, the block `print(-1)` and `sys.exit()` are not executed.\n9. **Post Loop Checks**:\n    - Check if `N == 1` and `l[0] == 0`. The condition `if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:` is false, so the block is not executed.\n10. **Building the Answer String**:\n    - Initialize the answer string `ans = \"\"`. The statement `ans = \"\"` is covered.\n    - Check `if not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0`. The condition is false, so the block is not executed.\n    - Build the answer string in a loop. The loop `for i in range(N-m):` is executed twice. The statement `ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)` is covered twice.\n11. **Print the Answer**:\n    - Print the answer string `print(ans)`. The statement `print(ans)` is covered.\n12. **Check the Answer String**:\n    - Initialize the flag `flag = False`. The statement `flag = False` is covered.\n    - Check the answer string in a loop. The loop `for i in range(N-m):` is executed twice. The conditions and checks within the loop are executed, but the block `print(-1)` and `sys.exit()` are not executed.\n13. **Print the Final Answer**:\n    - Print the final answer string `print(ans)`. The statement `print(ans)` is covered.\n\n### Code Coverage Based on the Execution Plan:\n\n```python\n> import sys, re, os\n> from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter\n> from math import ceil, sqrt, hypot, factorial, pi, sin, cos, radians\n> from itertools import permutations, combinations, product, accumulate\n> from operator import itemgetter, mul\n> from copy import deepcopy\n> from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits\n> from functools import reduce\n> from bisect import bisect_left, insort_left\n> from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop\n> INPUT = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n> INT = lambda: int(INPUT())\n> MAP = lambda: map(int, INPUT().split())\n> S_MAP = lambda: map(str, INPUT().split())\n> LIST = lambda: list(map(int, INPUT().split()))\n> S_LIST = lambda: list(map(str, INPUT().split()))\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)\n> INF = float('inf')\n> mod = 10 ** 9 + 7\n> def main():\n>     N, M = MAP()\n>     m = N\n>     l = [10] * N\n>     for i in range(M):\n>         s, c = MAP()\n>         if l[s-1] == 10:\n>             l[s-1] = c\n>             m = s - 1 if s-1 < m else m\n!         else:\n!             if c != l[s-1]:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 sys.exit()\n>     if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:\n!         print(0)\n!         sys.exit()\n>     ans = \"\"\n!     if not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0: ans += \"1\"\n>     for i in range(N-m):\n>         ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)\n>     print(ans)\n>     flag = False\n>     for i in range(N-m):\n>         if not int(ans[i]) == 0:\n>             flag = True\n>         if not flag and int(ans[i]) == 0:\n!             print(-1)\n!             sys.exit()\n>     print(ans)\n> if __name__ == '__main__':\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\nThe final answer printed twice as per the code logic.\n```\n12\n12\n```",

Since `M` is 2, it will run twice.\n   ```python\n   > for i in range(M):\n   ```\n\n7. **First Iteration of the Loop:**\n   Reading `s` and `c` from input.\n   ```python\n   > s, c = MAP()\n   ```\n\n8. **First Iteration Condition Check:**\n   Since `l[s-1]` is 10, it will enter the first if block.\n   ```python\n   > if l[s-1] == 10:\n   > l[s-1] = c\n   > m = s - 1 if s-1 < m else m\n   ```\n\n9. **Second Iteration of the Loop:**\n   Reading `s` and `c` again from input.\n   ```python\n   > s, c = MAP()\n   ```\n\n10. **Second Iteration Condition Check:**\n    Since `l[s-1]` is now set to `0`, it will not enter the first if block, but will check the else condition.\n    ```python\n    > else:\n    > if c != l[s-1]:\n    ```\n\n11. **Else Condition Satisfied:**\n    Since `c` is not different from `l[s-1]`, this condition is not satisfied, and no further block is executed within this else clause.\n\n12. **Special Case Check:**\n    The special case where `N` is 1 and `l[0]` is 0 is not satisfied, so this block is skipped.\n    ```python\n    ! if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:\n    ! print(0)\n    ! sys.exit()\n    ```\n\n13. **Constructing the Answer String:**\n    Building the answer string `ans`.\n    ```python\n    > ans = \"\"\n    > if not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0: ans += \"1\"\n    > for i in range(N-m):\n    > ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)\n    ```\n\n14. **Printing Intermediate Answer:**\n    Printing the intermediate answer.\n    ```python\n    > print(ans)\n    ```\n\n15. **Flag and Final Answer Check:**\n    Checking the final answer and flag.\n    ```python\n    > flag = False\n    > for i in range(N-m):\n    > if not int(ans[i]) == 0:\n    > flag = True\n    > if not flag and int(ans[i]) == 0:\n    > print(-1)\n    > sys.exit()\n    ```\n\n16. **Printing Final Answer:**\n    Printing the final answer.\n    ```python\n    > print(ans)\n    ```\n\n17. **Main Guard:**\n    The main guard ensures that the main function is executed.\n    ```python\n    > if __name__ == '__main__':\n    > main()\n    ```\n\n### Code Coverage:\n```python\n> import sys, re, os\n> from collections import deque, defaultdict, Counter\n> from math import ceil, sqrt, hypot, factorial, pi, sin, cos, radians\n> from itertools import permutations, combinations, product, accumulate\n> from operator import itemgetter, mul\n> from copy import deepcopy\n> from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase, digits\n> from functools import reduce\n> from bisect import bisect_left, insort_left\n> from heapq import heapify, heappush, heappop\n> INPUT = lambda: sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()\n> INT = lambda: int(INPUT())\n> MAP = lambda: map(int, INPUT().split())\n> S_MAP = lambda: map(str, INPUT().split())\n> LIST = lambda: list(map(int, INPUT().split()))\n> S_LIST = lambda: list(map(str, INPUT().split()))\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 9)\n> INF = float('inf')\n> mod = 10 ** 9 + 7\n> def main():\n>     N, M = MAP()\n>     m = N\n>     l = [10] * N\n>     for i in range(M):\n>         s, c = MAP()\n>         if l[s-1] == 10:\n>             l[s-1] = c\n>             m = s - 1 if s-1 < m else m\n>         else:\n>             if c != l[s-1]:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 sys.exit()\n!     if N == 1 and l[0] == 0:\n!         print(0)\n!         sys.exit()\n>     ans = \"\"\n>     if not len(l) == N-m and l[m] == 0: ans += \"1\"\n>     for i in range(N-m):\n>         ans += str(l[i+m] % 10)\n>     print(ans)\n>     flag = False\n>     for i in range(N-m):\n>         if not int(ans[i]) == 0:\n>             flag = True\n>         if not flag and int(ans[i]) == 0:\n>             print(-1)\n>             sys.exit()\n>     print(ans)\n> if __name__ == '__main__':\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n00\n00\n```\n\nIn this execution, no exceptions were raised, and the code ran to completion.
