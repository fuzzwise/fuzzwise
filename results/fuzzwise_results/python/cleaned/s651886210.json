After that, `j = 3` because `s[3]` is 'o'.\n\n   ```python\n   j = 1\n   if s[j] == 'x':\n       while s[j] == 'x':\n           j += 1\n   ```\n\n9. **Recursive Call to `bool_work`:** The function is called recursively with `s[j:]`, `n - j`, `k`, and `c`. \n   \n   - The new parameters are `s[3:] = \"o\"`, `n - 3 = 1`, `k = 2`, and `c = 1`.\n\n   ```python\n   wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)\n   ```\n\n10. **New `bool_work` Execution:** The new call to `bool_work` with `s=\"o\"`, `n=1`, `k=2`, `c=1`:\n   \n    - Initialization: `i = 0`\n    - The while loop `while s[i] == 'o':` will execute since `s[0]` is 'o'.\n    - The `if` condition `if i + c + 1 < n` evaluates to `2 < 1`, which is false. Therefore, we move to the `elif` block.\n\n    ```python\n    elif i + c + 1 >= n:\n        if k > 1:\n            return 0\n    ```\n\n    - Since `k > 1`, the function returns 0 (`wo_i = 0`).\n\n11. **Update `j` and Nested `if`:** Check if `j < i + c + 1`, which is `3 < 2`, is false. Therefore, this block is skipped.\n\n    ```python\n    if j < i + c + 1:\n    ```\n\n12. **Second Recursive Call to `bool_work`:** The function is called again with `s[j:]`, `n - j`, `k - 1`, and `c`.\n    - The new parameters are `s[3:] = \"o\"`, `n - 3 = 1`, `k - 1 = 1`, and `c = 1`.\n\n    ```python\n    w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)\n    ```\n\n13. **New `bool_work` Execution:** For the second recursive call with `s=\"o\"`, `n=1`, `k=1`, `c=1`:\n   \n    - Initialization: `i = 0`\n    - The while loop `while s[i] == 'o':` will execute since `s[0]` is 'o'.\n    - The `if` condition `if i + c + 1 < n` evaluates to `2 < 1`, which is false. Therefore, we move to the `elif` block.\n\n    ```python\n    elif i + c + 1 >= n:\n        if k > 1:\n            return 0\n        elif n == 1:\n            return 1\n    ```\n\n    - Since `n == 1`, the function returns 1 (`w_i = 1`).\n\n14. **Evaluating Results:** The results `wo_i = 0` and `w_i = 1` are used to determine the return value of the initial call.\n\n    ```python\n    if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:\n        common.append(i)\n        return 1\n    ```\n\n    - Since `wo_i == 0` and `w_i == 1`, append `i` (which is 0) to `common` and return 1.\n\n15. **Printing Results:** The for loop prints each element in `common`.\n\n    ```python\n    for com in common:\n        print(com)\n    ```\n\n    - The value `0` is printed from the `common` list.\n\n**Final Code Coverage:**\n```python\n> common = []\n> def bool_work(s, n, k, c):\n>     i = 0\n>     while s[i] == 'o':\n>         if i+c+1 < n:\n>             j = 1\n>             if s[j] == 'x':\n>                 while s[j] == 'x':\n>                     j += 1\n>             wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)\n>             if j < i+c+1:\n!                 j = i+c+1\n!                 if s[j] == 'x':\n!                     while s[j] == 'x':\n!                         j += 1\n>             w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)\n>             if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:\n>                 common.append(i)\n>                 return 1\n!             if wo_i + w_i >= 2:\n!                 return 2\n>             else:\n>                 return wo_i + w_i\n>         elif i+c+1 >= n:\n>             if k > 1:\n>                 return 0\n!             elif n == 1:\n!                 return 1\n!             else:\n!                 for char in s[1:]:\n!                     if char == 'o':\n!                         return 2\n!                 return 1\n> n, k, c = map(int, input().split())\n> s = input()\n> while s[-1] == 'x':\n!     s.pop(-1)\n> bool_work(s, n, k, c)\n> for com in common:\n>     print(com)\n```\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nThe code correctly appends `0` to the `common` list and prints it, indicating that the first character 'o' is part of a valid sequence according to the logic defined in the `bool_work` function.",

            "covered_code": "### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution of the Python Program and Test Case:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: There are no import statements in the given code.\n2. **Global Variable Declaration**: The global variable `common` is declared and initialized as an empty list. This will always be executed.\n3. **Function Declaration**: The function `bool_work` is declared, which will always be executed.\n4. **Input Reading**: The input is read using `map(int, input().split())` and assigned to `n`, `k`, and `c`. This will always be executed.\n5. **String Input Reading**: The string `s` is read using `input()`. This will always be executed.\n6. **While Loop for Removing Trailing 'x'**: The while loop `while s[-1] == 'x': s.pop(-1)` is used to remove trailing 'x' characters from the string `s`. This will be executed as long as there are trailing 'x' characters.\n7. **Function Call**: The `bool_work` function is called with arguments `s, n, k, c`. This will always be executed.\n8. **For Loop to Print Common Elements**: The for loop `for com in common: print(com)` is executed to print elements in the `common` list. This will be executed if there are elements in the `common` list.\n\n### Code Coverage Based on the Test Case Input `0 0 0`:\n\nGiven the complexity and the recursive nature of the function `bool_work`, we will need to analyze the specific inputs and predict how the code will execute.\n\n**Test Case Input:**\n```\n0 0 0\n```\n**Program Execution Steps:**\n\n1. Input reading:\n    ```\n    n, k, c = map(int, input().split())  # This will read 0, 0, 0\n    s = input()  # This will read an empty string since no input is provided\n    ```\n\n2. Since `s` is empty, the while loop `while s[-1] == 'x': s.pop(-1)` will not execute as there is no last character to check for 'x'.\n\n3. The `bool_work` function is called with the arguments `s, n, k, c`. Since `s` is empty, the body of `bool_work` will not be executed, and the function will return `None`.\n\n4. The for loop `for com in common: print(com)` will not execute as the `common` list remains empty.\n\n### Detailed Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> common = []\n> def bool_work(s, n, k, c):\n>     i = 0\n!     while s[i] == 'o':\n!         if i+c+1 < n:\n!             j = 1\n!             if s[j] == 'x':\n!                 while s[j] == 'x':\n!                     j += 1\n!             wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)\n!             if j < i+c+1:\n!                 j = i+c+1\n!                 if s[j] == 'x':\n!                     while s[j] == 'x':\n!                         j += 1\n!             w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)\n!             if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:\n!                 common.append(i)\n!                 return 1\n!             if wo_i + w_i >= 2:\n!                 return 2\n!             else:\n!                 return wo_i + w_i\n!         elif i+c+1 >= n:\n!             if k > 1:\n!                 return 0\n!             elif n == 1:\n!                 return 1\n!             else:\n!                 for char in s[1:]:\n!                     if char == 'o':\n!                         return 2\n!                 return 1\n> n, k, c = map(int, input().split())\n> s = input()\n! while s[-1] == 'x':\n!     s.pop(-1)\n> bool_work(s, n, k, c)\n! for com in common:\n!     print(com)\n```\n\n### Runtime Exception Raised:\nNone, the program executed without raising any exceptions. However, no significant operations were performed due to the empty string input.\n\nIn summary, the provided test case input `0 0 0` and an empty string resulted in minimal code execution, primarily involving input reading and no significant logic execution within the `bool_work` function.",

Import statements: Not applicable here as there are no import statements.\n2. Global variables: Always executed. Statement `common = []` is covered.\n3. Function definition: Always executed. Statement `def bool_work(s, n, k, c):` is covered.\n4. Input parsing: Always executed. Statements `n, k, c = map(int, input().split())` and `s = input()` are covered.\n5. While loop for string manipulation: \n    - The while loop `while s[-1] == 'x':` will be executed since the last character of the input string `s` is 'x'.\n    - Inside the loop, `s.pop(-1)` will raise a TypeError because `s` is a string, not a list.\n\n### Step-by-step execution:\n\n1. The program starts execution and initializes `common` with an empty list.\n2. The function `bool_work` is defined.\n3. Input is taken and parsed:\n   - For the input `0 2 3`, `n`, `k`, and `c` are set to 0, 2, and 3 respectively.\n   - For the input `oxxoxx`, `s` is set to the string `'oxxoxx'`.\n4. The while loop `while s[-1] == 'x':` evaluates to `True` since `s[-1]` is 'x'.\n5. The program attempts to execute `s.pop(-1)`, which raises a `TypeError` because `s` is a string.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> common = []\n> def bool_work(s, n, k, c):\n!     i = 0\n!     while s[i] == 'o':\n!         if i+c+1 < n:\n!             j = 1\n!             if s[j] == 'x':\n!                 while s[j] == 'x':\n!                     j += 1\n!             wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)\n!             if j < i+c+1:\n!                 j = i+c+1\n!                 if s[j] == 'x':\n!                     while s[j] == 'x':\n!                         j += 1\n!             w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)\n!             if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:\n!                 common.append(i)\n!                 return 1\n!             if wo_i + w_i >= 2:\n!                 return 2\n!             else:\n!                 return wo_i + w_i\n!         elif i+c+1 >= n:\n!             if k > 1:\n!                 return 0\n!             elif n == 1:\n!                 return 1\n!             else:\n!                 for char in s[1:]:\n!                     if char == 'o':\n!                         return 2\n!                 return 1\n> n, k, c = map(int, input().split())\n> s = input()\n> while s[-1] == 'x':\n!     s.pop(-1)\n! bool_work(s, n, k, c)\n! for com in common:\n!     print(com)\n```\n\n### Exception Raised:\nThe program raises a `TypeError`: `'str' object does not support item deletion` when it attempts to execute `s.pop(-1)`.\n\n### Corrected Code Coverage (if the string issue is fixed):\nIf the string manipulation issue is fixed (e.g., by converting the string to a list), further analysis would be required to determine the complete code coverage.

            "covered_code": "To predict the code coverage of the given Python program based on the provided test case, we'll follow a step-by-step plan for the execution. Here's the detailed plan and the predicted code coverage:\n\n### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution\n\n1. **Import Statements**: Not applicable as there are no import statements in the code.\n2. **Global Variable Declaration**: The global variable `common` is initialized. The statement `common = []` is always executed.\n3. **Function Declaration**: The function `bool_work` is declared. The statement `def bool_work(s, n, k, c):` is always executed.\n4. **Main Code Execution**:\n   - **Input Reading**: The input values `n`, `k`, and `c` are read, and the string `s` is read. The statements `n, k, c = map(int, input().split())` and `s = input()` are always executed.\n   - **While Loop for Trimming**: The while loop checks and removes trailing 'x' characters from the string `s`. The statement `while s[-1] == 'x':` is executed, and the statement `s.pop(-1)` may or may not be executed based on the input string.\n   - **Function Call**: The function `bool_work` is called with the parameters `s`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. The statement `bool_work(s, n, k, c)` is executed.\n5. **Function Execution**:\n   - **Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0. The statement `i = 0` is always executed.\n   - **While Loop**: The while loop checks if the character at index `i` is 'o'. The statement `while s[i] == 'o':` is executed, and the loop's body is executed based on the condition.\n   - **If-Else Conditions**: The various conditions inside the while loop are evaluated and executed based on the input string and variables.\n6. **Output**: The for loop prints the elements in `common`. The statement `for com in common:` and `print(com)` are executed if there are elements in `common`.\n\n### Code Coverage Prediction\n\nGiven the input `2 1 1` and `oo`, let's predict the code coverage:\n\n```python\ncommon = []\ndef bool_work(s, n, k, c):\n    i = 0\n    > while s[i] == 'o':\n        > if i + c + 1 < n:\n            > j = 1\n            > if s[j] == 'x':\n                ! while s[j] == 'x':\n                    ! j += 1\n            > wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)\n            > if j < i + c + 1:\n                > j = i + c + 1\n                > if s[j] == 'x':\n                    ! while s[j] == 'x':\n                        ! j += 1\n            > w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)\n            > if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:\n                > common.append(i)\n                > return 1\n            > if wo_i + w_i >= 2:\n                > return 2\n            > else:\n                > return wo_i + w_i\n        > elif i + c + 1 >= n:\n            > if k > 1:\n                > return 0\n            > elif n == 1:\n                > return 1\n            > else:\n                > for char in s[1:]:\n                    > if char == 'o':\n                        > return 2\n                > return 1\nn, k, c = map(int, input().split())\ns = input()\n! while s[-1] == 'x':\n    ! s.pop(-1)\n> bool_work(s, n, k, c)\n> for com in common:\n    > print(com)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Code Coverage\n\n1. **Global Variable Declaration**:\n   - `common = []` is executed.\n\n2. **Function Declaration**:\n   - `def bool_work(s, n, k, c):` is executed.\n\n3. **Main Code Execution**:\n   - `n, k, c = map(int, input().split())` is executed.\n   - `s = input()` is executed.\n   - `while s[-1] == 'x':` is not executed since `s` does not end with 'x'.\n   - `bool_work(s, n, k, c)` is executed.\n\n4. **Function Execution**:\n   - `i = 0` is executed.\n   - `while s[i] == 'o':` is executed and the loop body is entered.\n   - `if i + c + 1 < n:` is executed.\n   - `j = 1` is executed.\n   - `if s[j] == 'x':` is not executed since `s[1]` is 'o'.\n   - `wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)` is executed.\n   - The recursive call follows the same steps as above.\n   - `if j < i + c + 1:` is executed.\n   - `j = i + c + 1` is executed.\n   - `if s[j] == 'x':` is not executed since `s[2]` is out of range.\n   - `w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)` is executed.\n   - `if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:` is executed.\n   - `common.append(i)` is executed.\n   - `return 1` is executed.\n   - `if wo_i + w_i >= 2:` and `return 2` are not executed.\n   - `else:` and `return wo_i + w_i` are not executed.\n   - `elif i + c + 1 >= n:` is not executed.\n   - `if k > 1:` is not executed.\n   - `elif n == 1:` is not executed.\n   - `else:` is not executed.\n   - `for char in s[1:]:` and `if char == 'o':` are not executed.\n   - `return 2` is not executed.\n   - `return 1` is not executed.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - `for com in common:` is executed.\n   - `print(com)` is executed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage\n\n```python\ncommon = []\ndef bool_work(s, n, k, c):\n    i = 0\n    > while s[i] == 'o':\n        > if i + c + 1 < n:\n            > j = 1\n            > if s[j] == 'x':\n                ! while s[j] == 'x':\n                    ! j += 1\n            > wo_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k, c)\n            > if j < i + c + 1:\n                > j = i + c + 1\n                > if s[j] == 'x':\n                    ! while s[j] == 'x':\n                        ! j += 1\n            > w_i = bool_work(s[j:], n - j, k - 1, c)\n            > if wo_i == 0 and w_i == 1:\n                > common.append(i)\n                > return 1\n            > if wo_i + w_i >= 2:\n                > return 2\n            > else:\n                > return wo_i + w_i\n        > elif i + c + 1 >= n:\n            > if k > 1:\n                > return 0\n            > elif n == 1:\n                > return 1\n            > else:\n                > for char in s[1:]:\n                    > if char == 'o':\n                        > return 2\n                > return 1\nn, k, c = map(int, input().split())\ns = input()\n! while s[-1] == 'x':\n    ! s.pop(-1)\n> bool_work(s, n, k, c)\n> for com in common:\n    > print(com)\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```\n0\n```",
