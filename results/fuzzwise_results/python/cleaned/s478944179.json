            "covered_code": "To predict the code coverage of the given Python program with the test case input `1 1` and `1 5`, we need to develop a step-by-step plan for the execution of the code snippet and determine whether each line is executed or not.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution Plan:\n\n1. **Input Parsing:**\n   - The first line reads `N, M = map(int, input().split())`.\n   - Input: `1 1`\n   - `N` is assigned the value `1`\n   - `M` is assigned the value `1`\n\n2. **Initialization:**\n   - `s = []`\n   - `c = []`\n   - `num = [0] * N` results in `num = [0]`.\n\n3. **Function `judge` Declaration:**\n   - The function `judge` is declared.\n\n4. **Function `judge` Execution:**\n   - **First For Loop:**\n     - The loop `for i in range(M):` runs from `0` to `M-1` (i.e., 0).\n     - Input: `1 5`\n     - `s1` is assigned the value `1`\n     - `c1` is assigned the value `5`\n     - `s.append(s1)` results in `s = [1]`\n     - `c.append(c1)` results in `c = [5]`\n\n   - **Second For Loop (Checking for conflicting rules):**\n     - The nested loop `for i in range(M):` and `for j in range(M):` both run from `0` to `M-1` (i.e., 0).\n     - Since `i == j`, the condition `s[i] == s[j] and i != j and c[i] != c[j]` is not satisfied and the loop completes without executing `print(-1)` or `return`.\n\n   - **Handling Different Values of `N`:**\n     - Since `N` is `1`, the control goes to the `else` block.\n     - The condition `if s[i] != 2:` is checked with `i = 0` and `s[0] = 1`. Since `s[0] != 2`, `print(-1)` is executed and the function returns.\n\n5. **Handling Invalid Cases for `N = 3` and `N = 2`:**\n   - These blocks are not executed since `N` is `1`.\n\n6. **Handling `num[0] == 0`:**\n   - These blocks are not executed since the function already returned.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n\nBased on the above plan, the code coverage for the given Python program is as follows:\n\n```python\n> N, M = map(int, input().split())\n> s = []\n> c = []\n> num = [0] * N\n> def judge():\n>     for i in range(M):\n>         s1, c1 = map(int, input().split())\n>         s.append(s1)\n>         c.append(c1)\n>     for i in range(M):\n>         for j in range(M):\n>             if s[i] == s[j] and i != j and c[i] != c[j]:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 return\n>     if N == 3:\n!         for i in range(M):\n!             if s[i] - 1 < 0 or s[i] - 1 > 2:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 return\n!             num[s[i] - 1] = c[i]\n>     elif N == 2:\n!         for i in range(M):\n!             if s[i] < 1 or s[i] > 2:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 return\n!             num[s[i] - 1 + 1] = c[i]\n>     else:\n>         if s[i] != 2:\n>             print(-1)\n>             return\n!         num[s[i] - 1 + 2] = c[i]\n!     if num[0] == 0:\n!         if num[1] == 0:\n!             if num[2] == 0:\n!                 print(-1)\n!                 return\n!             print(num[2])\n!         print(\"{0}{1}\".format(num[1], num[2]))\n!         return\n!     else:\n!         print(\"{0}{1}{2}\".format(num[0], num[1], num[2]))\n!         return\n> judge()\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n-1\n```\n\nThe final output is `-1` as the function returns early due to the invalid input for `N = 1`.",
