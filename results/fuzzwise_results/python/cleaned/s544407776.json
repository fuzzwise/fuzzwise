This will be executed.\n    - `if T == 3: raise 1` is checked but not executed since `T` is not `3`.\n\n6. **Initialize `ans` List**: An empty list `ans` is initialized.\n    - `ans = []` is executed.\n\n7. **Outer Loop for Test Cases**:\n    - `for t in range(T):` creates a loop that will iterate `T` times (2 times in this case).\n\n8. **First Iteration of Outer Loop (`t = 0`)**:\n    - `N = int(rl())` reads the second input value which is `1`. This will be executed.\n    - `val = 0` initializes `val`.\n    - `a1 = [[] for i in range(N)]` creates a list of empty lists.\n    - `a2 = [[] for i in range(N)]` creates another list of empty lists.\n\n    **Inner Loop for `N` Values**:\n    - `for _ in range(N):` creates a loop that will iterate `N` times (1 time in this case).\n        - `i, v1, v2 = map(int, rl().split())` reads the next set of inputs `1 1 -1`. This will be executed.\n        - `i -= 1` adjusts the index.\n        - `diff = v1 - v2` calculates the difference.\n        - `if diff == 0 or i == N-1:` condition is checked and executed.\n        - `val += v1` adds `v1` to `val`.\n\n    **Processing `a1` and `a2`**:\n    - `for ax in (a1, a2):` loops through `a1` and `a2`.\n    - `dq = []` initializes an empty list.\n    - `ld = 0` initializes `ld`.\n    - `for i, aa in enumerate(ax):` iterates through `ax`.\n        - If `aa` is empty, `continue`.\n        - No elements in `aa`, so `continue` is executed in each case.\n\n    **Store Result**:\n    - `ans.append(val)` stores the result.\n\n9. **Second Iteration of Outer Loop (`t = 1`)**:\n    - `N = int(rl())` reads the next input value which is `2`. This will be executed.\n    - `val = 0` initializes `val`.\n    - `a1 = [[] for i in range(N)]` creates a list of empty lists.\n    - `a2 = [[] for i in range(N)]` creates another list of empty lists.\n\n    **Inner Loop for `N` Values**:\n    - `for _ in range(N):` creates a loop that will iterate `N` times (2 times in this case).\n        - First Iteration:\n            - `i, v1, v2 = map(int, rl().split())` reads `2 3 4`. This will be executed.\n            - `i -= 1` adjusts the index.\n            - `diff = v1 - v2` calculates the difference.\n            - `elif diff < 0:` condition is executed.\n            - `i = N-1-i-1` adjusts the index.\n            - `a2[i].append(-diff)` adds `-diff` to `a2`.\n            - `val += v1` adds `v1` to `val`.\n        - Second Iteration:\n            - `i, v1, v2 = map(int, rl().split())` reads `5 6 7`. This will be executed.\n            - `i -= 1` adjusts the index.\n            - `diff = v1 - v2` calculates the difference.\n            - `elif diff < 0:` condition is executed.\n            - `i = N-1-i-1` adjusts the index.\n            - `a2[i].append(-diff)` adds `-diff` to `a2`.\n            - `val += v1` adds `v1` to `val`.\n\n    **Processing `a1` and `a2`**:\n    - `for ax in (a1, a2):` loops through `a1` and `a2`.\n    - `dq = []` initializes an empty list.\n    - `ld = 0` initializes `ld`.\n    - `for i, aa in enumerate(ax):` iterates through `ax`.\n        - If `aa` is empty, `continue`.\n        - No elements in `a1`, so `continue` is executed.\n        - Elements in `a2`:\n            - `heappush(dq, diff)` pushes `diff` into `dq`.\n            - `ld += 1` increments `ld`.\n            - `val += sum(dq)` adds the sum of `dq` to `val`.\n\n    **Store Result**:\n    - `ans.append(val)` stores the result.\n\n10. **Print Results**:\n    - `print(*ans, sep=\"\\n\")` prints the results.\n\n### Code Coverage\n\nBased on the above plan, the code coverage is as follows:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> iim = lambda: map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())\n> from heapq import heappush, heappushpop\n> def resolve():\n>     rl = sys.stdin.readline\n>     T = int(rl())\n>     if T == 3: raise 1\n>     ans = []\n>     for t in range(T):\n>         N = int(rl())\n>         val = 0\n>         a1 = [[] for i in range(N)]\n>         a2 = [[] for i in range(N)]\n>         for _ in range(N):\n>             i, v1, v2 = map(int, rl().split())\n>             i -= 1\n>             diff = v1 - v2\n>             if diff == 0 or i == N-1:\n>                 val += v1\n>             elif diff > 0:\n!                 a1[i].append(diff)\n>                 val += v2\n>             else:\n>                 i = N-1-i-1\n>                 a2[i].append(-diff)\n>                 val += v1\n>         for ax in (a1, a2):\n>             dq = []\n>             ld = 0\n>             for i, aa in enumerate(ax):\n>                 if not aa: continue\n>                 for diff in aa:\n>                     if ld <= i:\n>                         heappush(dq, diff)\n>                         ld += 1\n>                     else:\n>                         heappushpop(dq, diff)\n>             val += sum(dq)\n>         ans.append(val)\n>     print(*ans, sep=\"\\n\")\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>     resolve()\n```\n\n### Output\n\nThe execution of the second test case does not match the expected number of inputs, leading to a `ValueError` when trying to unpack values. Therefore, the program will raise an exception:\n\n```\nValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)\n```",

Statements `import sys`, `from heapq import heappush, heappushpop` will be covered.\n2. **Lambda Function**: The lambda function `iim = lambda: map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` is defined but not executed immediately. It is not covered at this point.\n3. **Function Declaration**: The function `resolve()` is declared but not executed immediately.\n4. **Main Guard Execution**: The main guard `if __name__ == \"__main__\": resolve()` is evaluated. Since the script is being run directly, the `resolve()` function will be called.\n   \n**Inside the `resolve()` function:**\n\n5. **Reading Input**: Statement `rl = sys.stdin.readline` is executed, defining `rl` as a shortcut for reading lines from standard input.\n6. **Reading Number of Test Cases**: Statement `T = int(rl())` is executed. Given the test input, the first value read is `0`, so `T` is set to `0`.\n7. **Check for Specific Condition**: The `if T == 3:` condition is checked. Since `T` is `0`, this condition is not satisfied, so the `raise 1` statement is not executed.\n8. **Initialize Answer List**: Statement `ans = []` is executed, initializing an empty list `ans`.\n9. **For Loop on Test Cases**: The for loop `for t in range(T):` is executed. However, since `T` is `0`, the loop body is never executed.\n10. **Print Results**: The statement `print(*ans, sep=\"\\n\")` is executed. Since `ans` is empty, nothing is printed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage Based on Test Case\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> iim = lambda: map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())\n> from heapq import heappush, heappushpop\n> def resolve():\n>     rl = sys.stdin.readline\n>     T = int(rl())\n>     if T == 3: raise 1\n>     ans = []\n!     for t in range(T):\n!

Statements `import sys` and `from heapq import heappush, heappushpop` will be covered.\n\n2. **Lambda Function Definition:**\n   - The lambda function `iim` is defined but not executed unless explicitly called. Statement `iim = lambda: map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())` is covered.\n\n3. **Function Definition:**\n   - The function `resolve` is defined but not executed until called. Statement `def resolve():` is covered.\n\n4. **Main Function Execution:**\n   - The `resolve` function is called within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block. Statement `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` is covered.\n   - Statement `resolve()` is covered.\n\n5. **Reading Input:**\n   - The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline`. Statement `rl = sys.stdin.readline` is covered.\n   - The first line read is the value of `T`. Statement `T = int(rl())` is covered.\n\n6. **Condition Check:**\n   - The condition `if T == 3: raise 1` is checked.\n   - Since `T` is 3 in the given test case, the condition is true and the exception is raised. Statement `if T == 3: raise 1` is covered.\n   - The exception `raise 1` is executed, causing the program to terminate. Statement `raise 1` is covered.\n\n### Code Coverage Based on the Above Plan:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> iim = lambda: map(int, sys.stdin.readline().rstrip().split())\n> from heapq import heappush, heappushpop\n> def resolve():\n>     rl = sys.stdin.readline\n>     T = int(rl())\n>     if T == 3: raise 1\n!     ans = []\n!     for t in range(T):\n!
