Variables `k`, `x`, and `y` are set to `0`.\n4. **Conditional Check**: `if k % 2 == 0 and (x + y) % 2 == 1:` is evaluated. Since `k = 0` and `x + y = 0`, the condition is `False`. The `else` block is executed.\n5. **Function Call**: The function `solve(0, 0, 0)` is called.\n6. **Function Execution**: Inside the `solve` function:\n    - `if x == y == 0: return []` is evaluated. Since `x = 0` and `y = 0`, the condition is `True` and the function returns an empty list `[]`.\n7. **Output**: `ans = []`, `print(len(ans))` prints `0`.\n8. **Loop**: The for loop `for x, y in ans:` does not execute because `ans` is empty.\n9. **End of Program**: The program ends.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> def solve(x, y, k):\n>     if x == y == 0: return []\n!     if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k: return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)\n!     if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k: return [(0, k)] + solve(x, y - k, k)\n!     if x < 0: return [(-x, y) for x, y in solve(-x, y, k)]\n!     if y < 0: return [(x, -y) for x, y in solve(x, -y, k)]\n!     if x > y: return [(x, y) for y, x in solve(y, x, k)]\n!     if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1: return solve(x, y + k, k) + [(0, -k)]\n!     if k % 2 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0: return solve(x, y - k, k) + [(0, k)]\n!     z = (x + y) // 2\n!     return [(k - z + x, z - x), (z - k, z)]\n> k, x, y = map(int, open(0).read().split())\n> if k % 2 == 0 and (x + y) % 2 == 1:\n!     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     ans = solve(x, y, k)\n>     print(len(ans))\n>     ax, ay = 0, 0\n>     for x, y in ans:\n!         ax += x\n!         ay += y\n!         print(ax, ay)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Only the relevant lines for the test case input `0 0 0` are executed.\n- The program does not raise any exceptions for this input.",

Given the input is `1 1 1`, `k=1`, `x=1`, and `y=1`.\n\n4. **Conditional Check:**\n   - The first conditional check `if k % 2 == 0 and (x + y) % 2 == 1:` is evaluated:\n     - Since `k=1`, `k % 2 == 0` is `False`, hence the condition fails.\n   - The `else` block is executed.\n\n5. **Calling the `solve` Function:**\n   - The function `solve(x, y, k)` is called with `x=1`, `y=1`, and `k=1`.\n\n6. **Execution of the `solve` Function:**\n   - The internal conditions of the `solve` function are evaluated in order:\n     - `if x == y == 0:` condition fails.\n     - `if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k:` condition fails.\n     - `if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k:` condition fails.\n     - `if x < 0:` condition fails.\n     - `if y < 0:` condition fails.\n     - `if x > y:` condition fails.\n     - `if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1:` condition fails.\n     - `if k & 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0:` condition fails.\n   - The final `return` statement is executed, calculating `z = (x + y) // 2`:\n     - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`\n     - Returns `[(1 - 1 + 1, 1 - 1), (1 - 1, 1)] = [(1, 0), (0, 1)]`\n\n7. **Printing Results:**\n   - `ans = [(1, 0), (0, 1)]`\n   - `print(len(ans))` prints `2`\n   - The loop iterates over `ans`:\n     - For `(1, 0)`, prints `1 0`\n     - For `(0, 1)`, prints `1 1`\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n```python\n> def solve(x, y, k):\n>     if x == y == 0: return []\n>     if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k: return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)\n>     if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k: return [(0, k)] + solve(x, y - k, k)\n>     if x < 0: return [(-x, y) for x, y in solve(-x, y, k)]\n>     if y < 0: return [(x, -y) for x, y in solve(x, -y, k)]\n>     if x > y: return [(x, y) for y, x in solve(y, x, k)]\n>     if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1: return solve(x, y + k, k) + [(0, -k)]\n>     if k & 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0: return solve(x, y - k, k) + [(0, k)]\n>     z = (x + y) // 2\n>     return [(k - z + x, z - x), (z - k, z)]\n\n> k, x, y = map(int, open(0).read().split())\n> if k % 2 == 0 and (x + y) % 2 == 1:\n>     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     ans = solve(x, y, k)\n>     print(len(ans))\n>     ax, ay = 0, 0\n>     for x, y in ans:\n>         ax += x\n>         ay += y\n>         print(ax, ay)\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n2\n1 0\n1 1\n```",

This will correctly parse `K=1`, `X=0`, and `Y=0`.\n2. **Check Condition**: The condition `if K % 2 == 0 and (X + Y) % 2 == 1:` is checked. This condition will evaluate to `False` because `K` is `1` which is odd, so the code inside the `else` block will be executed.\n3. **Call solve Function**: The `solve` function is called with `X=0`, `Y=0`, and `K=1`. This will directly return an empty list `[]` because the condition `if x == y == 0:` is `True`.\n4. **Print Length of ans**: The length of `ans` (which is `0`) is printed.\n5. **Print Coordinates**: Since `ans` is an empty list, the loop printing coordinates will not execute.\n\n### Code Coverage:\nBased on the above plan, we can determine which lines of code are executed:\n\n```python\n> def solve(x, y, k):\n>     if x == y == 0:\n>         return []\n!     if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k:\n!         return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)\n!     if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k:\n!         return [(0, k)] + solve(x, y - k, k)\n!     if x < 0:\n!         return [(-x, y) for x, y in solve(-x, y, k)]\n!     if y < 0:\n!         return [(x, -y) for x, y in solve(x, -y, k)]\n!     if x > y:\n!         return [(x, y) for y, x in solve(y, x, k)]\n!     if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1:\n!         return solve(x, y + k, k) + [(0, -k)]\n!     if k & 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0:\n!         return solve(x, y - k, k) + [(0, k)]\n!     z = (x + y) // 2\n!     return [(k - z + x, z - x), (z - k, z)]\n\n> K, X, Y = map(int, open(0).read().split())\n> if K % 2 == 0 and (X + Y) % 2 == 1:\n!     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     ans = solve(X, Y, K)\n>     print(len(ans))\n>     ax, ay = 0, 0\n>     for x, y in ans:\n!         ax += x\n!         ay += y\n!         print(ax, ay)\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n0\n```\n\n### Summary:\n- The `solve` function is called but only the first condition (`if x == y == 0:`) is met and executed.\n- The rest of the code in `solve` is not executed.\n- The `else` block of the main logic is executed, but the loop inside `else` will not execute because `ans` is empty.\n\nThis provides a clear prediction of the code coverage based on the given test case and execution plan.",

Here is the detailed plan and the final code coverage:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function `solve(x, y, k)` is defined but not executed until it is called.\n\n2. **Global Variables and Input**:\n   - `K`, `X`, and `Y` are read from input using `map(int, open(0).read().split())`.\n   - In this test case, the input will be `1` (for `K`), `1` (for `X`), and `1` (for `Y`).\n\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - The program then checks if `K % 2 == 0` and `(X + Y) % 2 == 1`. \n   - If true, it prints `-1` and exits.\n   - Otherwise, it calls the `solve` function and processes the result.\n\n4. **Function Execution**:\n   - The function `solve(X, Y, K)` is called with `X = 1`, `Y = 1`, and `K = 1`.\n\n### Detailed Execution:\n\n1. **Input Reading and Global Variables**:\n   ```python\n   K, X, Y = map(int, open(0).read().split())\n   ```\n   - This line reads the input and assigns values to `K`, `X`, and `Y`.\n   - For the test case, `K = 1`, `X = 1`, `Y = 1`.\n\n2. **Main Logic**:\n   ```python\n   if K % 2 == 0 and (X + Y) % 2 == 1:\n       print(-1)\n   else:\n       ans = solve(X, Y, K)\n       print(len(ans))\n       ax, ay = 0, 0\n       for x, y in ans:\n           ax += x\n           ay += y\n           print(ax, ay)\n   ```\n   - The condition `K % 2 == 0 and (X + Y) % 2 == 1` evaluates to `False` since `K % 2` is `1` and `(X + Y) % 2` is `0`.\n   - Therefore, the program skips the `print(-1)` statement and enters the `else` block.\n   - It calls the `solve` function with `X = 1`, `Y = 1`, and `K = 1`.\n\n3. **Function `solve` Execution**:\n   ```python\n   def solve(x, y, k):\n       if x == y == 0: return []\n       if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k: return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)\n       if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k: return [(0, k)] + solve(x, y - k, k)\n       if x < 0: return [(-x, y) for x, y in solve(-x, y, k)]\n       if y < 0: return [(x, -y) for x, y in solve(x, -y, k)]\n       if x > y: return [(x, y) for y, x in solve(y, x, k)]\n       if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1: return solve(x, y + k, k) + [(0, -k)]\n       if k % 2 == 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0: return solve(x, y - k, k) + [(0, k)]\n       z = (x + y) // 2\n       return [(k - z + x, z - x), (z - k, z)]\n   ```\n   - The `solve` function evaluates each condition in sequence.\n   - For `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `k = 1`:\n     - `x == y == 0` is `False`.\n     - `x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k` is `True` since `2 >= 2` and `1 >= 1`.\n     - Therefore, it executes `return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)`.\n     - The new call to `solve(0, 1, 1)` returns `[(k, 0)]`.\n\n4. **Processing the Result**:\n   ```python\n   ans = solve(X, Y, K)\n   print(len(ans))\n   ax, ay = 0, 0\n   for x, y in ans:\n       ax += x\n       ay += y\n       print(ax, ay)\n   ```\n   - `ans` is assigned the value `[(1, 0)]`.\n   - `print(len(ans))` prints `1`.\n   - The for loop iterates over `ans` and prints `1 0`.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n```python\n> def solve(x, y, k):\n>     if x == y == 0: return []\n>     if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k: return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)\n!     if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k: return [(0, k)] + solve(x, y - k, k)\n!     if x < 0: return [(-x, y) for x, y in solve(-x, y, k)]\n!     if y < 0: return [(x, -y) for x, y in solve(x, -y, k)]\n!     if x > y: return [(x, y) for y, x in solve(y, x, k)]\n!     if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1: return solve(x, y + k, k) + [(0, -k)]\n!     if k % 2 == 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0: return solve(x, y - k, k) + [(0, k)]\n>     z = (x + y) // 2\n!     return [(k - z + x, z - x), (z - k, z)]\n> K, X, Y = map(int, open(0).read().split())\n> if K % 2 == 0 and (X + Y) % 2 == 1:\n!     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     ans = solve(X, Y, K)\n>     print(len(ans))\n>     ax, ay = 0, 0\n>     for x, y in ans:\n>         ax += x\n>         ay += y\n>         print(ax, ay)\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\n1\n1 0\n```",

Hence, the condition is `False`.\n\n3. **Else Block Execution**:\n    - The `else` block is executed.\n    - Call `solve(0, 1, 1)`.\n\n4. **Function `solve` Execution**:\n    - `solve(0, 1, 1)`:\n        - The first condition `if x == y == 0` is `False`.\n        - The second condition `if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k` is `False` because `0 + 1 < 2 * 1`.\n        - The third condition `if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k` is `False` because `0 + 1 < 2 * 1`.\n        - The fourth condition `if x < 0` is `False`.\n        - The fifth condition `if y < 0` is `False`.\n        - The sixth condition `if x > y` is `False`.\n        - The seventh condition `if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1` is `False` because `0 + 1 < 1` is `False`.\n        - The eighth condition `if k % 2 == 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0` is `True` because `1 % 2 == 1` is `True`, `0 + 1 > 1` is `False`. Hence, the condition is `False`.\n        - The last condition is reached, and `z = (x + y) // 2` assigns `z=0`. The function returns `[(1 - 0 + 0, 0 - 0), (0 - 1, 0)]` which is `[(1, 0), (-1, 0)]`.\n\n5. **Printing Results**:\n    - `ans = [(1, 0), (-1, 0)]`\n    - The length of `ans` is `2`, so `print(len(ans))` outputs `2`.\n    - Initialize `ax, ay = 0, 0`.\n    - For each tuple `(x, y)` in `ans`, update `ax` and `ay` and print:\n        - First tuple `(1, 0)`: `ax += 1` and `ay += 0`, so `print(1, 0)`.\n        - Second tuple `(-1, 0)`: `ax -= 1` and `ay += 0`, so `print(0, 0)`.\n\n### Final Code Coverage\n```python\n> def solve(x,y,k):\n>     if x == y == 0: return []\n>     if x + y >= 2 * k and x >= k: return [(k, 0)] + solve(x - k, y, k)\n>     if x + y >= 2 * k and y >= k: return [(0, k)] + solve(x, y - k, k)\n>     if x < 0: return [(-x, y) for x, y in solve(-x, y, k)]\n>     if y < 0: return [(x, -y) for x, y in solve(x, -y, k)]\n>     if x > y: return [(x, y) for y, x in solve(y, x, k)]\n>     if x + y < k and (x + y) % 2 == 1: return solve(x, y + k, k) + [(0, -k)]\n>     if k % 2 == 1 and x + y > k and (x + y) % k % 2 == 0: return solve(x, y - k, k) + [(0, k)]\n>     z = (x + y) // 2\n>     return [(k - z + x, z - x), (z - k, z)]\n> k, x, y = map(int, open(0).read().split())\n> if k % 2 == 0 and (x + y) % 2 == 1:\n!     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     ans = solve(x, y, k)\n>     print(len(ans))\n>     ax, ay = 0, 0\n>     for x, y in ans:\n>         ax += x\n>         ay += y\n>         print(ax, ay)\n```\n\n### Output\n```\n2\n1 0\n0 0\n```\n\nIn this case, the program does not raise an exception and completes normally, producing the expected output.",

Here's a step-by-step plan of execution and the expected code coverage:\n\n### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: There are no import statements.\n2. **Function Definition**: The `solve` function is defined.\n3. **Input Reading**: Inputs K, X, and Y are read from standard input.\n4. **Initial Condition Check**: The program checks if `K % 2 == 0 and (X + Y) % 2 == 1`.\n5. **Invocation of `solve` Function**: If the initial condition is not met, the `solve` function is invoked.\n6. **Printing the Results**: The results from the `solve` function are printed.\n\n### Detailed Execution with the Test Case (3, 2, 3):\n\n1. **Input Reading**:\n   - K = 3\n   - X = 2\n   - Y = 3\n\n2. **Initial Condition Check**:\n   - `K % 2 == 0` evaluates to `False` (since 3 % 2 == 1).\n   - The `else` block executes.\n\n3. **Invocation of `solve` Function**:\n   - The function `solve` is called with (2, 3, 3).\n\n4. **Execution of `solve` Function**:\n   - Since `x != 0` and `y != 0`, the first condition is not met.\n   - `x + y >= 2 * k` and `x >= k` evaluates to `False` (since 5 >= 6 is False).\n   - `x + y >= 2 * k` and `y >= k` evaluates to `False` (since 3 >= 3 is True, but 5 >= 6 is False).\n   - `x < 0` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `y < 0` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `x > y` evaluates to `False`.\n   - `x + y < k` and `(x + y) % 2 == 1` evaluates to `False` (since 5 < 3 is False).\n   - `K & 1` and `x + y > k` and `(x + y) % k % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True` (since 3 & 1 is True, 5 > 3 is True, and 5 % 3 % 2 == 0 is True).\n\n5. **Recursion in `solve` Function**:\n   - The `solve` function is recursively called with `(2, 0, 3)`.\n\n6. **Base Case in Recursion**:\n   - Since `x != 0` and `y == 0`, the first condition is not met.\n   - `x + y >= 2 * k` and `x >= k` evaluates to `False`.\n   - The subsequent conditions are not met until the last condition, where `x + y < k` is True, but `(x + y) % 2 == 1` is True.\n   - The function returns an empty list due to the base case not being implemented correctly.\n\n7. **Back to Main Function**:\n   - The main function continues to print the results from `solve`, but since it's an empty list, nothing is printed.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\nFollowing the given test case, here is the code coverage:\n\n```python\n> def solve(x,y,k):\n>     if x==y==0: return []\n>     if x+y>=2*k and x>=k: return [(k,0)]+solve(x-k,y,k)\n>     if x+y>=2*k and y>=k: return [(0,k)]+solve(x,y-k,k)\n>     if x<0: return [(-x,y) for x,y in solve(-x,y,k)]\n>     if y<0: return [(x,-y) for x,y in solve(x,-y,k)]\n>     if x>y: return [(x,y) for y,x in solve(y,x,k)]\n>     if x+y<K and (x+y)%2==1: return solve(x,y+k,k)+[(0,-k)]\n>     if K&1 and x+y>k and (x+y)%k%2==0: return solve(x,y-k,k)+[(0,k)]\n>     z=(x+y)//2\n>     return [(k-z+x,z-x),(z-k,z)]\n> K,X,Y=map(int, open(0).read().split())\n> if K%2==0 and (X+Y)%2==1:\n>     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     ans=solve(X,Y,K)\n>     print(len(ans))\n>     ax,ay=0,0\n>     for x,y in ans:\n>         ax+=x\n>         ay+=y\n>         print(ax,ay)\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```plaintext\n0\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The function `solve` was called but returned an empty list due to the conditions not being correctly handled for the provided inputs.\n- The main function prints the length of the result (which is 0) and no coordinates because the list is empty.\n- No `NotImplementedError` is raised in this case; the function simply returns an empty list.\n\n### Final Remarks:\n\nThis analysis shows the code coverage for the given test case inputs. The function logic needs to be reviewed and fixed to handle the expected cases correctly.",
