The actual lines executed within this function will depend on the input grid.\n    - For this input, `go_next` will be called multiple times to explore all possible paths.\n\n### Code Coverage Prediction:\n```python\n> import sys\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(50)\n> h,w=map(int,input().split())\n> def go_next(I,J):\n>     global dp,w,h\n>     if 0<=I<h-1:\n>         if x[I+1][J]==\".\" and dp[I+1][J]>dp[I][J]+1:\n>             dp[I+1][J]=dp[I][J]+1\n>             go_next(I+1,J)\n>     if 0<I<=h-1:\n>         if x[I-1][J]==\".\" and dp[I-1][J]>dp[I][J]+1:\n>             dp[I-1][J]=dp[I][J]+1\n>             go_next(I-1,J)\n>     if 0<=J<w-1:\n>         if x[I][J+1]==\".\" and dp[I][J+1]>dp[I][J]+1:\n>             dp[I][J+1]=dp[I][J]+1\n>             go_next(I,J+1)\n>     if 0<J<=w-1:\n>         if x[I][J-1]==\".\" and dp[I][J-1]>dp[I][J]+1:\n>             dp[I][J-1]=dp[I][J]+1\n>             go_next(I,J-1)\n> x=[]\n> for i in range(h):\n>     x.append(list(input()))\n> c=0\n> for i in range(h):\n>     for j in range(w):\n>         if x[i][j]==\".\":\n>             c+=1\n> dp=[[10000000000 for i in range(w)]for j in range(h)]\n> dp[0][0]=1\n> go_next(0,0)\n> if dp[h-1][w-1]==10000000000:\n>     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     print(c-dp[h-1][w-1])\n```\n\n### Final Notes:\n- The recursive function `go_next` will be executed multiple times based on the input grid.\n- The exact coverage of the lines within `go_next` will vary depending on how the paths are explored.\n- For the given input, all recursive calls will be made, and the final output will be printed based on the dp table values.",

Below are the detailed steps:\n\n### Test Case Input:\n```\n2 2\n..\n..\n```\n\n### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution:\n1. **Import Statements:** Import statements are always executed.\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   ```\n   ```python\n   sys.setrecursionlimit(50)\n   ```\n\n2. **Input Handling:** The program reads input values for `h` and `w`.\n   ```python\n   h, w = map(int, input().split())\n   ```\n\n3. **Function Definition:** The function `go_next` is defined but not executed yet.\n   ```python\n   def go_next(I, J):\n       global dp, w, h\n       ...\n   ```\n\n4. **Initialization of x:** The list `x` is initialized to store the grid.\n   ```python\n   x = []\n   ```\n\n5. **Grid Input:** The program reads the grid input and appends it to `x`.\n   ```python\n   for i in range(h):\n       x.append(list(input()))\n   ```\n\n6. **Grid Traversal for Counting Dots:** The program counts the number of dots (`.`) in the grid.\n   ```python\n   c = 0\n   for i in range(h):\n       for j in range(w):\n           if x[i][j] == \".\":\n               c += 1\n   ```\n\n7. **Initialization of dp:** The 2D list `dp` is initialized to store distances.\n   ```python\n   dp = [[10000000000 for i in range(w)] for j in range(h)]\n   dp[0][0] = 1\n   ```\n\n8. **Function Call:** The function `go_next` is called to start the recursion.\n   ```python\n   go_next(0, 0)\n   ```\n\n9. **Final Check and Output:** The program checks the final value of `dp` and prints the result.\n   ```python\n   if dp[h-1][w-1] == 10000000000:\n       print(-1)\n   else:\n       print(c - dp[h-1][w-1])\n   ```\n\n### Code Coverage:\nFollowing the above plan, we can determine which lines are executed and which are not, along with the exception raised:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(50)\n> h, w = map(int, input().split())\n> def go_next(I, J):\n>     global dp, w, h\n>     if 0 <= I < h-1:\n>         if x[I+1][J] == \".\" and dp[I+1][J] > dp[I][J] + 1:\n>             dp[I+1][J] = dp[I][J] + 1\n>             go_next(I+1, J)\n>     if 0 < I <= h-1:\n>         if x[I-1][J] == \".\" and dp[I-1][J] > dp[I][J] + 1:\n>             dp[I-1][J] = dp[I][J] + 1\n>             go_next(I-1, J)\n>     if 0 <= J < w-1:\n>         if x[I][J+1] == \".\" and dp[I][J+1] > dp[I][J] + 1:\n>             dp[I][J+1] = dp[I][J] + 1\n>             go_next(I, J+1)\n>     if 0 < J <= w-1:\n>         if x[I][J-1] == \".\" and dp[I][J-1] > dp[I][J] + 1:\n>             dp[I][J-1] = dp[I][J] + 1\n>             go_next(I, J-1)\n> x = []\n> for i in range(h):\n>     x.append(list(input()))\n> c = 0\n> for i in range(h):\n>     for j in range(w):\n>         if x[i][j] == \".\":\n>             c += 1\n> dp = [[10000000000 for i in range(w)] for j in range(h)]\n> dp[0][0] = 1\n> go_next(0, 0)\n> if dp[h-1][w-1] == 10000000000:\n>     print(-1)\n> else:\n>     print(c - dp[h-1][w-1])\n```\n\n### Exception Raised:\nSince the input provided is valid for the program (2 2 followed by two lines of \"..\"), no `TypeError` is raised in this scenario. The program should execute without any exceptions.\n\n### Output:\nGiven the input, the program will correctly compute the number of reachable cells and output the result.",
