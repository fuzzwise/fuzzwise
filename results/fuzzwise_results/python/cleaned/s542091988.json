`import sys`\n   - `sysread = sys.stdin.buffer.readline`\n   - `read = sys.stdin.buffer.read`\n   - `sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)`\n   \n2. **Constant and Function Definitions**: Always executed.\n   - `INF = 1 << 100`\n   - `def run():`\n   \n3. **Reading Input**: Always executed.\n   - `N, K = map(int, sysread().split())`\n   - `P = list(map(int, sysread().split()))`\n   - `C = list(map(int, sysread().split()))`\n   -

`val += loop[j]`\n                       - `max_val = max(val, max_val)`\n                   - `j += 1`\n                   - `if not j == 1: iter += 1`\n                   - `if done: break`\n                   - `if i == j: done = True`\n               - `ans = max(ans, max_val)`\n               - `continue`\n           - `rest = K`\n           - `rest -= len(loop) - i - 1`\n           - `val += loopSum[-1] - loopSum[i]`\n           - `val += (rest // (len(loop)-1)) * loopSum[-1]`\n           - `rest = rest % (len(loop) - 1)`\n           - `val += max(loopSum[1:rest+1])`\n           - `ans = max(ans, val)`\n\n10. **Final Print Statement**: Always executed if no exceptions are raised.\n    - `print(ans)`\n\n11. **Main Execution Block**: Always executed.\n    - `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`\n        - `run()`\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```plaintext\n> import sys\n> sysread = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n> read = sys.stdin.buffer.read\n> sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)\n> INF = 1 << 100\n> def run():\n>     N, K = map(int, sysread().split())\n>     P = list(map(int, sysread().split()))\n>     C = list(map(int, sysread().split()))\n>     P = [p-1 for p in P]\n>     loops = []\n>     checked = [0] * N\n>     loop = [0]\n>     for i in range(N):\n>         current = i\n>         while True:\n>             if not checked[current]:\n>                 checked[current] = 1\n>                 loop.append(C[current])\n>                 current = P[current]\n>             else:\n>                 if len(loop) == 1: break\n>                 loops.append(loop)\n>                 loop = [0]\n>                 break\n>     loopSums = []\n>     for loop in loops:\n>         val = 0\n>         tmp = []\n>         for l in loop:\n>             val += l\n>             tmp.append(val)\n>         loopSums.append(tmp)\n>     ans = -INF\n>     for loop, loopSum in zip(loops, loopSums):\n>         for i in range(1, len(loop)):\n>             val = 0\n>             if loopSum[-1] <= 0 or len(loop)-1 > K:\n>                 j = i\n>                 max_val = -INF\n>                 iter = 0\n>                 done = False\n>                 while iter <= K:\n>                     if j >= len(loop): j = 0\n>                     if (i != j and j) or done:\n>                         val += loop[j]\n>                         max_val = max(val, max_val)\n>                     j += 1\n>                     if not j == 1: iter += 1\n>                     if done: break\n>                     if i == j: done = True\n>                 ans = max(ans, max_val)\n>                 continue\n>             rest = K\n>             rest -= len(loop) -
