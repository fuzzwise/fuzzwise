            "covered_code": "Let's develop a step-by-step execution plan for the given Python program and predict the code coverage based on the provided test cases:\n\n### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Import statements**: Import statements are always executed.\n2. **Reading Input**: \n   - `read = sys.stdin.buffer.read`, `readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline`, and `readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines` are executed.\n   - `N, M, S = map(int, readline().split())` reads three integers which are always executed.\n   - `ABC = [list(map(int, readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]` reads M lines of input which are always executed.\n   - `m = map(int, read().split())` reads the remaining input values which are always executed.\n   - `CD = list(zip(m, m))` creates a list of tuples from the read input values which are always executed.\n3. **Graph Initialization**: `graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]` initializes an empty adjacency list which is always executed.\n4. **Filling Graph**: `for u, v, a, b in ABC:` iterates over the edges and fills the adjacency list which is always executed.\n5. **Function Declaration and Execution**:\n   - The function `f()` is defined and called, so `def f():` and the call `ab = f()` are executed.\n   - Inside `f()`:\n     - `INF = 10 ** 18`, `arrive = [False]*n`, `ans = []`, `qq = 2500` and `dist = [[INF] * qq for _ in range(N)]` initialize various variables and data structures which are always executed.\n     - `dist[0][min(qq-1, S)] = 0` initializes the starting point which is always executed.\n     - `q = [(0, min(qq-1, S), 0)]` initializes the priority queue which is always executed.\n6. **Main Loop**: `while q:` is a loop that iterates as long as priority queue `q` is not empty:\n   - `st, ss, v = heappop(q)` pops an element from the priority queue which is always executed.\n   - `if dist[v][ss] < st:` checks if the current state is optimal which is always executed.\n   - `if not arrive[v]:` checks if the vertex `v` has been visited which is always executed.\n     - `arrive[v] = True` marks the vertex as visited which is always executed.\n     - `ans.append((v, st))` adds the vertex and state to the answer list which is always executed.\n     - `if all(arrive):` checks if all vertices have been visited which is always executed.\n   - `c, d = CD[v]` retrieves the cost and time for the current vertex which is always executed.\n   - `if ss < qq-1:` checks if the current state can be increased which is always executed.\n     - `ns = min(ss + c, qq-1)` and `nt = st + d` calculate new state and time which are always executed.\n     - `if dist[v][ns] > nt:` checks if the new state is optimal which is always executed.\n       - `dist[v][ns] = nt` updates the distance which is always executed.\n       - `heappush(q, (nt, ns, v))` pushes the new state into the priority queue which is always executed.\n   - `for nex, g, tt in graph[v]:` iterates over the neighbors which are always executed.\n     - `if ss-g < 0:` checks if the current state is valid which is always executed.\n     - `dt = st + tt` calculates new time which is always executed.\n     - `if dist[nex][ss-g] <= dt:` checks if the new state is optimal which is always executed.\n       - `dist[nex][ss-g] = dt` updates the distance which is always executed.\n       - `heappush(q, (dt, ss-g, nex))` pushes the new state into the priority queue which is always executed.\n7. **Return Statement**: `return ans` returns the result which is always executed.\n8. **Sorting and Printing Results**:\n   - `from operator import itemgetter` imports the itemgetter function which is always executed.\n   - `ab = sorted(ab, key=itemgetter(0))` sorts the results which is always executed.\n   - `for i in range(N-1): print(ab[i][1])` prints the results which are always executed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> read = sys.stdin.buffer.read\n> readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n> readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines\n> from heapq import heappush, heappop\n> N, M, S = map(int, readline().split())\n> ABC = [list(map(int, readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n> m = map(int, read().split())\n> CD = list(zip(m, m))\n> graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n> for u, v, a, b in ABC:\n>     graph[u-1].append((v-1,a,b))\n>     graph[v-1].append((u-1,a,b))\n> def f():\n>   INF = 10 ** 18\n>   arrive = [False]*n\n>   ans = []\n>   qq = 2500\n>   dist = [[INF] * qq for _ in range(N)]\n>   dist[0][min(qq-1,S)] = 0\n>   q = [(0,min(qq-1,S),0)]\n>   while q:\n>       st, ss, v = heappop(q) \n>       if dist[v][ss] < st:\n>         continue\n>       if not arrive[v]:\n>         arrive[v] = True\n>         ans.append((v,st))\n>         if all(arrive):\n>           break\n>       c, d = CD[v]\n>       if ss < qq-1:\n>           ns = min(ss + c, qq-1)\n>           nt = st + d\n>           if dist[v][ns] > nt:\n>               dist[v][ns] = nt\n>               heappush(q,(nt,ns,v))\n>       for nex,g,tt in graph[v]:\n>           if ss-g < 0:\n>               continue\n>           dt = st + tt\n>           if dist[nex][ss-g] <= dt:\n>               continue\n>           dist[nex][ss-g] = dt\n>           heappush(q,(dt,ss-g,nex))\n>   return ans\n> ab = f()\n> from operator import itemgetter\n> ab = sorted(ab,key=itemgetter(0))\n> for i in range(N-1):\n>   print(ab[i][1])\n```\n\n### Output:\n\nThis code snippet does not directly raise exceptions based on the given inputs, so no exceptions are expected to occur.

            "covered_code": "To determine the code coverage of the given Python program based on the provided test case inputs, we'll follow a systematic plan to predict which lines of code are executed and which are not. Here's a step-by-step execution of the code snippet.\n\n### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution\n\n1. **Import Statements**: Import statements are always executed.\n2. **Reading Input**:\n   - `read = sys.stdin.buffer.read` is always executed.\n   - `readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline` is always executed.\n   - `readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines` is always executed.\n3. **Library Import**: `from heapq import heappush, heappop` is always executed.\n4. **Reading Initial Values**:\n   - `N, M, S = map(int, readline().split())` is executed with input `1 0 0`.\n5. **Reading ABC List**:\n   - `ABC = [list(map(int, readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]` is executed, but since `M = 0`, the list `ABC` will be empty.\n6. **Reading CD List**:\n   - `m = map(int, read().split())` is executed with inputs `1 2 3 4 5 6`.\n   - `CD = list(zip(m, m))` is executed, resulting in `CD = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]`.\n7. **Graph Initialization**:\n   - `graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]` is executed with `N = 1`, so `graph = [[]]`.\n8. **Populating Graph**:\n   - `for u, v, a, b in ABC:` is executed but since `ABC` is empty, the loop body is not executed.\n9. **Function Definition and Call**:\n   - `def f():` is executed.\n   - `ab = f()` is executed, which triggers the execution of the function `f`.\n\n### Inside Function `f()` Execution Steps\n\n10. **Initialization**:\n    - `INF = 10 ** 18` is executed.\n    - `arrive = [False] * N` is executed with `N = 1`, resulting in `arrive = [False]`.\n    - `ans = []` is executed.\n    - `qq = 2500` is executed.\n    - `dist = [[INF] * qq for _ in range(N)]` is executed with `N = 1`, resulting in `dist = [[INF, INF, ..., INF]]` (length 2500).\n    - `dist[0][min(qq - 1, S)] = 0` is executed with `S = 0`, resulting in `dist[0][0] = 0`.\n    - `q = [(0, min(qq - 1, S), 0)]` is executed, resulting in `q = [(0, 0, 0)]`.\n11. **While Loop**:\n    - `while q:` is executed, starting the loop since `q` is not empty.\n    - `st, ss, v = heappop(q)` is executed, popping `(0, 0, 0)` from `q`.\n    - `if dist[v][ss] < st:` is checked, but `dist[0][0]` is not less than `0`, so the condition is false.\n    - `if not arrive[v]:` is executed and `arrive[0]` is `False`.\n    - `arrive[0] = True` is executed, setting `arrive[0]` to `True`.\n    - `ans.append((v, st))` is executed, appending `(0, 0)` to `ans`.\n    - `if all(arrive):` is executed and is true since `arrive = [True]`, so the loop breaks.\n12. **Return from Function**:\n    - `return ans` is executed, returning `ans = [(0, 0)]`.\n\n### Post-Function Execution\n\n13. **Sorting and Printing**:\n    - `from operator import itemgetter` is always executed.\n    - `ab = sorted(ab, key=itemgetter(0))` is executed, but `ab` is already sorted.\n    - `for i in range(N - 1):` is executed but since `N = 1`, the loop body is not executed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage\n\nBased on the above steps, the code coverage is as follows:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> read = sys.stdin.buffer.read\n> readline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n> readlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines\n> from heapq import heappush, heappop\n> N,M,S = map(int,readline().split())\n> ABC = [list(map(int,readline().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n> m = map(int,read().split())\n> CD = list(zip(m,m))\n> graph = [[] for _ in range(N)]\n! for u,v,a,b in ABC:\n!     graph[u-1].append((v-1,a,b))\n!     graph[v-1].append((u-1,a,b))\n> def f():\n>   INF = 10 ** 18\n>   arrive = [False]*N\n>   ans = []\n>   qq = 2500\n>   dist = [[INF] * qq for _ in range(N)]\n>   dist[0][min(qq-1,S)] = 0\n>   q = [(0,min(qq-1,S),0)]\n>   while q:\n>       st,ss,v = heappop(q)\n>       if dist[v][ss] < st:\n>         continue\n>       if not arrive[v]:\n>         arrive[v] = True\n>         ans.append((v,st))\n>         if all(arrive):\n>           break\n>       c,d = CD[v]\n>       if ss < qq-1:\n>           ns = min(ss + c, qq-1)\n>           nt = st + d\n>           if dist[v][ns] > nt:\n>               dist[v][ns] = nt\n>               heappush(q,(nt,ns,v))\n>       for nex,g,tt in graph[v]:\n>           if ss-g < 0:\n>               continue\n>           dt = st + tt\n>           if dist[nex][ss-g] <= dt:\n>               continue\n>           dist[nex][ss-g] = dt\n>           heappush(q,(dt,ss-g,nex))\n>   return ans\n> ab = f()\n> from operator import itemgetter\n> ab = sorted(ab,key=itemgetter(0))\n! for i in range(N-1):\n!   print(ab[i][1])\n```\n\n### Output:\nNo runtime exception raised. The program completes execution successfully. The output will be empty since `N-1` is 0, so the final print statements do not execute.",
