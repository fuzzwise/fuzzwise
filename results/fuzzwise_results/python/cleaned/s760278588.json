However, since `H` is empty, `dp` cannot be populated correctly.\n\n5. **First IF Condition:**\n   - `if dp[0][0][0] != 0:` is not covered because `dp[0][0][0]` does not exist due to invalid `H`.\n\n6. **Main Loop for DP Update:**\n   - `for y in H:` is not executed because `H` is empty.\n\n7. **Final Print Statement:**\n   - `print(max([dp[i][h-1][w-1] for i in range(4)]))` is not executed because the main loop is not entered.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n```python\n> def main():\n>   import sys\n>   input = sys.stdin.readline\n>   h, w, k = map(int, input().split())\n>   H = range(h)\n>   W = range(w)\n>   dp = [[[0] * w for j in H] for i in range(4)]\n!   for _ in range(k):\n!     r, c, v = map(int, input().split())\n!     dp[r-1][c-1][0] = v\n!   if dp[0][0][0] != 0:\n!     dp[1][0][0] = dp[0][0][0]\n!     dp[0][0][0] = 0\n!   for y in H:\n!     for x in W:\n!       v = dp[0][y][x]\n!       dp[0][y][x] = 0\n!       for i in range(4):\n!         if 0 < x:\n!           if dp[i][y][x] < dp[i][y][x-1]:\n!             dp[i][y][x] = dp[i][y][x-1]\n!           if 0 < i and v != 0 and dp[i][y][x] < dp[i-1][y][x-1] + v:\n!             dp[i][y][x] = dp[i-1][y][x-1] + v\n!         if 0 < y:\n!           if dp[0][y][x] < dp[i][y-1][x]:\n!             dp[0][y][x] = dp[i][y-1][x]\n!           if v != 0 and dp[1][y][x] < dp[i][y-1][x] + v:\n!             dp[1][y][x] = dp[i][y-1][x] + v\n!   print(max([dp[i][h-1][w-1] for i in range(4)]))\n> main()\n```\n\n### Runtime Exception:\n```\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '-2'\n```\n\nThe test case input contains a negative value for `h`, which is invalid for creating a range.

            "covered_code": "To predict the code coverage of the given Python program based on the provided test case input, we need to develop a detailed plan of step-by-step execution. Here is the plan:\n\n### Plan for Step-by-Step Execution\n1. **Import Statements**: The import statement for `sys` and the assignment `input=sys.stdin.readline` are always executed.\n2. **Main Function Declaration**: The `def main():` line is always executed.\n3. **Input Reading and Parsing**: The line `h, w, k = map(int, input().split())` will be executed to read the dimensions and number of values.\n4. **Range Assignments**: The lines `H = range(h)` and `W = range(w)` are executed to define ranges.\n5. **3D List Initialization**: The line `dp = [[[0] * w for j in H] for i in range(4)]` is executed to initialize the `dp` list.\n6. **Processing Input Values**: The for loop `for _ in range(k):` will be executed `k` times. Inside this loop, the line `r, c, v = map(int, input().split())` and the line `dp[r-1][c-1][0] = v` will be executed.\n7. **Initial Condition Check and Update**: The if statement `if dp[0][0][0] != 0:` will be checked and subsequent lines will be executed based on this condition.\n8. **Nested Loops for DP Calculation**: The nested loops `for y in H:` and `for x in W:` will be executed. Within these loops, the value of `v` is assigned and the inner loops `for i in range(4):` will be executed. Depending on conditions, various if statements and their bodies will be executed.\n9. **Final Calculation and Print**: The line `print(max([dp[i][h-1][w-1] for i in range(4)]))` will be executed to print the result.\n10. **Main Function Call**: The `main()` function call at the end of the script is executed.\n\n### Detailed Execution Plan\nLet's go through the provided test case input `0 5 3 1 2 5 3 4 2 5 6 8` and predict the code coverage:\n\n**Test Case Input**:\n```\n0 5 3\n1 2 5\n3 4 2\n5 6 8\n```\n\n**Plan**:\n1. `import sys` - always executed.\n2. `input=sys.stdin.readline` - always executed.\n3. `h, w, k = map(int, input().split())` - executed. Here `h=0`, `w=5`, `k=3`.\n4. `H=range(h)` - executed. `H=range(0)` which means `H` is an empty range.\n5. `W=range(w)` - executed. `W=range(5)`.\n6. `dp=[[[0]*w for j in H] for i in range(4)]` - executed. Since `H` is empty, `dp` will be a list of four empty lists.\n7. `for _ in range(k):` loop is executed 3 times.\n   1. First iteration: `r, c, v = map(int, input().split())` is executed. Here `r=1`, `c=2`, `v=5`. `dp[r-1][c-1][0] = v` is executed, but since `dp` is a list of empty lists, this won't affect `dp`.\n   2. Second iteration: `r, c, v = map(int, input().split())` is executed. Here `r=3`, `c=4`, `v=2`. Similarly, `dp[r-1][c-1][0] = v` is executed but has no effect.\n   3. Third iteration: `r, c, v = map(int, input().split())` is executed. Here `r=5`, `c=6`, `v=8`. Similarly, `dp[r-1][c-1][0] = v` is executed but has no effect.\n8. `if dp[0][0][0] != 0:` is executed. This condition is false because `dp[0][0][0]` is 0. The body of the if statement is not executed.\n9. Nested loops `for y in H:` and `for x in W:` are executed. Since `H` is an empty range, the outer loop doesn't execute, and thus the inner loops are not executed at all.\n10. `print(max([dp[i][h-1][w-1] for i in range(4)]))` is executed. Since `h=0`, `dp[i][h-1][w-1]` will raise an `IndexError` because `h-1` is `-1`.\n\n### Final Code Coverage\n```python\n>def main():\n>  import sys\n>  input=sys.stdin.readline\n>  h,w,k=map(int,input().split())\n>  H=range(h)\n>  W=range(w)\n>  dp=[[[0]*w for j in H] for i in range(4)]\n>  for _ in range(k):\n>    r,c,v=map(int,input().split())\n>    dp[r-1][c-1][0]=v\n!  if dp[0][0][0]!=0:\n!    dp[1][0][0]=dp[0][0][0]\n!    dp[0][0][0]=0\n!  for y in H:\n!    for x in W:\n!      v=dp[0][y][x]\n!      dp[0][y][x]=0\n!      for i in range(4):\n!        if 0<x:\n!          if dp[i][y][x]<dp[i][y][x-1]:\n!            dp[i][y][x]=dp[i][y][x-1]\n!          if 0<i and v!=0 and dp[i][y][x]<dp[i-1][y][x-1]+v:\n!            dp[i][y][x]=dp[i-1][y][x-1]+v\n!        if 0<y:\n!          if dp[0][y][x]<dp[i][y-1][x]:\n!            dp[0][y][x]=dp[i][y-1][x]\n!          if v!=0 and dp[1][y][x]<dp[i][y-1][x]+v:\n!            dp[1][y][x]=dp[i][y-1][x]+v\n>  print(max([dp[i][h-1][w-1] for i in range(4)]))\n>main()\n```\n\n### Exception Raised\n`IndexError` due to accessing `dp[i][-1][w-1]` when `h=0`.\n\n### Summary\nThe code coverage analysis indicates that the loop dependent on `h` did not execute due to `h=0`, resulting in an `IndexError`.",
