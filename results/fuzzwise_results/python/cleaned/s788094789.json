Therefore, the inner code block will not be executed.\n   ```\n   !   for _ in range(W):\n   !     s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])\n   ```\n\n5. **Nested Loops for DP Calculation:**\n   - The outer for loop will not be executed because `H` is 0. Therefore, the inner code blocks for the nested loops will not be executed.\n   ```\n   !   for h in range(H):\n   !     for w in range(W):\n   !       if h == 0 and w == 0:\n   !         if not s[0][0]:\n   !           dp[0][0] = 1\n   !       elif h == 0:\n   !         dp[0][w] = dp[0][w-1]\n   !         if s[0][w-1] and not s[0][w]:\n   !           dp[0][w] += 1\n   !       elif w == 0:\n   !         dp[h][0] = dp[h-1][0]\n   !         if s[h-1][0] and not s[h][0]:\n   !           dp[h][0] += 1\n   !       else:\n   !         temp_up = dp[h-1][w]\n   !         if s[h-1][w] and not s[h][w]:\n   !           temp_up += 1\n   !         temp_left = dp[h][w-1]\n   !         if s[h][w-1] and not s[h][w]:\n   !           temp_left += 1\n   !         dp[h][w] = min(temp_up, temp_left)\n   ```\n\n6. **Printing the Result:**\n   - The print statement will not be executed because the outer for loop did not run.\n   ```\n   !   print(dp[H-1][W-1])\n   ```\n\n7. **Main Execution Block:**\n   - The main execution block is executed, which calls the `resolve()` function.\n   ```\n   > if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n   >   resolve()\n   ```\n\nGiven that `H` is 0, the loops are not executed, and the code does not proceed to any computation or print statements.

Function Declaration: The function `resolve()` is defined but not yet executed.\n2. Main Execution: The `if __name__ == \"__main__\": resolve()` statement is executed, thus calling the `resolve()` function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution within `resolve()`:\n1. **Input Reading**:\n    - `H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))`: `H` and `W` are set to `1` and `1`, respectively. (executed)\n    - `s = []`: An empty list `s` is initialized. (executed)\n    - `dp = [[0] * W for i in range(H)]`: A 2D list `dp` with dimensions 1x1 initialized to `[[0]]`. (executed)\n  \n2. **Reading the Grid**:\n    - `for _ in range(W): s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])`: \n      - For `W=1`, this loop runs once.\n      - `input()` reads `\"#\"`.\n      - `s.append([False])` results in `s = [[False]]`. (executed)\n\n3. **Filling the DP Table**:\n    - `for h in range(H): for w in range(W):`: \n      - For `H=1` and `W=1`, these loops run once each for `h=0` and `w=0`.\n      - `if h == 0 and w == 0:`: The condition is true. (executed)\n        - `if not s[0][0]:`: The condition is true since `s[0][0]` is `False`. (executed)\n          - `dp[0][0] = 1`: `dp` is updated to `[[1]]`. (executed)\n\n4. **Printing Result**:\n    - `print(dp[H-1][W-1])`: `dp[0][0]` is printed, which is `1`. (executed)\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n```python\n> def resolve():\n>   H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))\n>   s = []\n>   dp = [[0] * W for i in range(H)]\n>   for _ in range(W):\n>     s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])\n>   for h in range(H):\n>     for w in range(W):\n>       if h == 0 and w == 0:\n>         if not s[0][0]:\n>           dp[0][0] = 1\n!       elif h == 0:\n!         dp[0][w] = dp[0][w-1]\n!         if s[0][w-1] and not s[0][w]:\n!           dp[0][w] += 1\n!       elif w == 0:\n!         dp[h][0] = dp[h-1][0]\n!         if s[h-1][0] and not s[h][0]:\n!           dp[h][0] += 1\n!       else:\n!         temp_up = dp[h-1][w]\n!         if s[h-1][w] and not s[h][w]:\n!           temp_up += 1\n!         temp_left = dp[h][w-1]\n!         if s[h][w-1] and not s[h][w]:\n!           temp_left += 1\n!         dp[h][w] = min(temp_up, temp_left)\n>   print(dp[H-1][W-1])\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>   resolve()\n```\n\n### OUTPUT:\n```\n1\n```",

            "covered_code": "To predict the code coverage for the given Python code snippet with the given test case input, we'll follow a detailed step-by-step execution plan. Here's the plan:\n\n### Execution Plan:\n\n1. **Function Definition:**\n   - The function `resolve()` is defined. This line is always executed.\n\n2. **Main Execution Block:**\n   - The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is executed, which calls the `resolve()` function. This line is always executed.\n\n3. **Inside `resolve()` Function:**\n   - The line `H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))` is executed to parse the first line of input, setting `H` and `W` to 2 and 2, respectively.\n   - The empty list `s` is initialized. This line is executed.\n   - The 2D list `dp` is initialized with zeros. This line is executed.\n\n4. **For Loop to Read Grid:**\n   - A loop runs for `W` times (2 iterations) to read the grid.\n   - In the first iteration, the line `s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])` converts the input \"#.\" to `[False, True]` and appends it to `s`.\n   - In the second iteration, the line `s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])` converts the input \".#\" to `[True, False]` and appends it to `s`.\n\n5. **Nested For Loops to Process Grid:**\n   - Two nested loops iterate over `H` and `W` to process the grid.\n   - For `h=0, w=0`:\n     - The line `if h == 0 and w == 0:` is executed, and since `s[0][0]` is `False`, `dp[0][0]` is set to `1`.\n   - For `h=0, w=1`:\n     - The line `elif h == 0:` is executed.\n     - The line `dp[0][w] = dp[0][w-1]` sets `dp[0][1]` to `dp[0][0]` (1).\n     - Since `s[0][0]` is `False` and `s[0][1]` is `True`, `dp[0][1] += 1` is not executed.\n   - For `h=1, w=0`:\n     - The line `elif w == 0:` is executed.\n     - The line `dp[h][0] = dp[h-1][0]` sets `dp[1][0]` to `dp[0][0]` (1).\n     - Since `s[0][0]` is `False` and `s[1][0]` is `True`, `dp[1][0] += 1` is not executed.\n   - For `h=1, w=1`:\n     - The line `else:` is executed.\n     - The line `temp_up = dp[h-1][w]` sets `temp_up` to `dp[0][1]` (1).\n     - Since `s[0][1]` is `True` and `s[1][1]` is `False`, `temp_up += 1` sets `temp_up` to 2.\n     - The line `temp_left = dp[h][w-1]` sets `temp_left` to `dp[1][0]` (1).\n     - Since `s[1][0]` is `True` and `s[1][1]` is `False`, `temp_left += 1` sets `temp_left` to 2.\n     - The line `dp[h][w] = min(temp_up, temp_left)` sets `dp[1][1]` to 2.\n\n6. **Print Result:**\n   - The line `print(dp[H-1][W-1])` prints the value of `dp[1][1]`, which is 2.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> def resolve():\n>   H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))\n>   s = []\n>   dp = [[0] * W for i in range(H)]\n>   for _ in range(W):\n>     s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])\n>   for h in range(H):\n>     for w in range(W):\n>       if h == 0 and w == 0:\n>         if not s[0][0]:\n>           dp[0][0] = 1\n>       elif h == 0:\n>         dp[0][w] = dp[0][w-1]\n>         if s[0][w-1] and not s[0][w]:\n>           dp[0][w] += 1\n>       elif w == 0:\n>         dp[h][0] = dp[h-1][0]\n>         if s[h-1][0] and not s[h][0]:\n>           dp[h][0] += 1\n>       else:\n>         temp_up = dp[h-1][w]\n>         if s[h-1][w] and not s[h][w]:\n>           temp_up += 1\n>         temp_left = dp[h][w-1]\n>         if s[h][w-1] and not s[h][w]:\n>           temp_left += 1\n>         dp[h][w] = min(temp_up, temp_left)\n>   print(dp[H-1][W-1])\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>   resolve()\n```\n\n### OUTPUT:\n```\n2\n```",

Main execution block `if __name__ == \"__main__\": resolve()`: Covered.\n4. `H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))`: Covered.\n5. `s = []`: Covered.\n6. `dp = [[0] * W for i in range(H)]`: Covered.\n7. `for _ in range(W): s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])`: Not executed because `W` is `0`.\n8. The entire nested loops `for h in range(H):` and `for w in range(W):`: Not executed because `H` and `W` are `0`.\n9. `print(dp[H-1][W-1])`: Covered but raises an `IndexError`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe provided test case results in an `IndexError` due to an attempt to access an element in an empty list `dp`. The code coverage analysis highlights which lines are executed and which are not, along with the runtime exception encountered.",

The code inside this block is executed, and since both `s[0][0]` and `s[0][1]` are `True`, `dp[0][w] += 1` is not executed.\n    - For `h = 1, w = 0`: The elif condition `elif w == 0` is met. The code inside this block is executed, and since both `s[0][0]` and `s[1][0]` are `True`, `dp[h][0] += 1` is not executed.\n    - For `h = 1, w = 1`: The else block is executed. Both `temp_up` and `temp_left` are calculated, but since all conditions involving `not s[h][w]` are not met, the increments do not execute.\n6. **Final Output**: The final value of `dp[H-1][W-1]` is printed.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n```python\n> def resolve():\n>   H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))\n>   s = []\n>   dp = [[0] * W for i in range(H)]\n>   for _ in range(W):\n>     s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])\n>   for h in range(H):\n>     for w in range(W):\n>       if h == 0 and w == 0:\n!         if not s[0][0]:\n!           dp[0][0] = 1\n>       elif h == 0:\n>         dp[0][w] = dp[0][w-1]\n!         if s[0][w-1] and not s[0][w]:\n!           dp[0][w] += 1\n>       elif w == 0:\n>         dp[h][0] = dp[h-1][0]\n!         if s[h-1][0] and not s[h][0]:\n!           dp[h][0] += 1\n>       else:\n>         temp_up = dp[h-1][w]\n!         if s[h-1][w] and not s[h][w]:\n!           temp_up += 1\n>         temp_left = dp[h][w-1]\n!         if s[h][w-1] and not s[h][w]:\n!           temp_left += 1\n>         dp[h][w] = min(temp_up, temp_left)\n>   print(dp[H-1][W-1])\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>   resolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Statements involving checks with `not s[...]` are not executed since the input provided does not trigger these conditions.\n- The main structure of the code is executed, but specific branches within the nested loops are not hit based on the given input.",

Import statements: There are no import statements in the provided code.\n2. Function `resolve` definition: This is always executed. Statements `def resolve():` and everything within its scope will be covered.\n3. Input reading and parsing: Statements `H, W = map(int, input().split(\" \"))` and `s = []` are covered.\n4. Initialization of `dp` table: Statement `dp = [[0] * W for i in range(H)]` is covered.\n5. Reading grid input: The loop `for _ in range(W):` and the statement `s.append([x == \".\" for x in list(input())])` within it are covered.\n6. Nested loops for processing the grid: The outer loop `for h in range(H):` and the inner loop `for w in range(W):` are covered.\n7. Conditional checks and updates in the nested loops: Detailed conditional statements and updates within the loops:\n   - `if h == 0 and w == 0:`\n   - `elif h == 0:`\n   - `elif w == 0:`\n   - `else:`\n8. Printing the result: The statement `print(dp[H-1][W-1])` is covered.\n9.
