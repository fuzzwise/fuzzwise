Import statements: Import statements are always executed.\n2. Function `main` declaration: The function declaration is always executed.\n3. Variable initialization and user input: Statements related to variable initialization and user input are executed provided the function `main` is called.\n4. Loops and conditions: Execution depends on the logic and input values.\n5. Final statements: Statements to print results or conclude the program are executed if the logic reaches those points.\n6.

Since `N` is `0`, `dp` will be `[-1]`.\n   - The line `dp[0] = 0` sets `dp[0]` to `0`. This line is always executed.\n   - Attempt to set `dp[1] = 0` raises an `IndexError` since `dp` has only one element. \n\n### Code Coverage (Considering the `IndexError`):\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> MATCH_NUM = [-1, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]\n> def main():\n>     N, M = [int(e) for e in input().split()]\n>     A = [int(e) for e in input().split()]\n>     dp = [-1 for _ in range(N+1)]\n>     dp[0] = 0\n!     dp[1] = 0\n!     for i in range(N+1):\n!         for a in A:\n!             dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-MATCH_NUM[a]] + 1)\n!     max_digit_num = dp[N]\n!

Hence, the code coverage reflects that execution stops at the line `dp[1] = 0` and subsequent lines are not executed.",

Statement `import sys` will be covered.\n2. **Input Function Assignment**: The statement `input = sys.stdin.readline` is always executed.\n3. **MATCH_NUM List Declaration**: The list declaration `MATCH_NUM = [-1, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]` is always executed.\n4. **Main Function Declaration**: The function declaration `def main():` is always executed.\n5. **Reading Input Values**: The statements `N, M = [int(e) for e in input().split()]` and `A = [int(e) for e in input().split()]` are executed. Given the input `2 2` and `1 2`, N will be 2, M will be 2, and A will be [1, 2].\n6. **dp Array Initialization**: The statement `dp = [-1 for _ in range(N+1)]` initializes the dp array to `[-1, -1, -1]`. The statements `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[1] = 0` modify it to `[0, 0, -1]`.\n7. **First Nested Loop**: The outer loop `for i in range(N+1):` runs from 0 to 2. The inner loop `for a in A:` runs for each element in A.\n\n   - For i = 0:\n     - a = 1: `dp[0] = max(dp[0], dp[0-MATCH_NUM[1]] + 1)` results in `dp[0] = max(0, dp[-2] + 1)`, causing an index error.\n     - a = 2: `dp[0] = max(dp[0], dp[0-MATCH_NUM[2]] + 1)` results in `dp[0] = max(0, dp[-5] + 1)`, causing an index error.\n   - For i = 1:\n     - a = 1: `dp[1] = max(dp[1], dp[1-MATCH_NUM[1]] + 1)` results in `dp[1] = max(0, dp[-1] + 1)`, causing an index error.\n     - a = 2: `dp[1] = max(dp[1], dp[1-MATCH_NUM[2]] + 1)` results in `dp[1] = max(0, dp[-4] + 1)`, causing an index error.\n   - For i = 2:\n     - a = 1: `dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[2-MATCH_NUM[1]] + 1)` results in `dp[2] = max(-1, dp[0] + 1)`, resulting in `dp[2] = 1`.\n     - a = 2: `dp[2] = max(dp[2], dp[2-MATCH_NUM[2]] + 1)` results in `dp[2] = max(1, dp[-3] + 1)`, causing an index error.\n\n8. **Calculate max_digit_num**: The statement `max_digit_num = dp[N]` sets `max_digit_num` to `dp[2]`, which is 1.\n9. **Sort Array A**: The statement `A.sort(reverse=True)` sorts A in descending order, making A = [2, 1].\n10. **Find min_cost**: The loop `for a in A:` iterates over A to find the minimum match cost.\n    - a = 2: `MATCH_NUM[2] < min_cost` results in `5 < 10`, so `min_cost` is updated to 5.\n    - a = 1: `MATCH_NUM[1] < min_cost` results in `2 < 5`, so `min_cost` is updated to 2.\n11. **Construct Result String**: The outer loop `for _ in range(max_digit_num):` runs once because `max_digit_num` is 1. The inner loop `for a in A:` checks the conditions to construct the result string.\n    - a = 2: `dp[N-MATCH_NUM[2]] == dp[N]-1` results in `dp[2-5] == 0`, causing an index error.\n    - a = 1: `dp[N-MATCH_NUM[1]] == dp[N]-1` results in `dp[2-2] == 0`, which is true. Then, `N-MATCH_NUM[1] <= min_cost and N-MATCH_NUM[1] != 0` results in `0 <= 2 and 0 != 0`, which is false. The result string is updated to `res += str(1)`, making `res = '1'`. `N` is updated to `N -= MATCH_NUM[1]`, making `N = 0`.\n12. **Print Result**: The statement `print(res)` prints the result string, which is '1'.\n13. **Main Function Call**: The statement `main()` is executed to start the program.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> MATCH_NUM = [-1, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6]\n> def main():\n>     N, M = [int(e) for e in input().split()]\n>     A = [int(e) for e in input().split()]\n>     dp = [-1 for _ in range(N+1)]\n>     dp[0] = 0\n>     dp[1] = 0\n>     for i in range(N+1):\n>         for a in A:\n>             dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-MATCH_NUM[a]] + 1)\n>     max_digit_num = dp[N]\n>     A.sort(reverse=True)\n>     min_cost = 10\n>     for a in A:\n>         if MATCH_NUM[a] < min_cost:\n>             min_cost = MATCH_NUM[a]\n>     res = ''\n>     for _ in range(max_digit_num):\n>         for a in A:\n>             if dp[N-MATCH_NUM[a]] == dp[N]-1:\n>                 if N-MATCH_NUM[a] <= min_cost and N-MATCH_NUM[a] != 0:\n!                     continue\n>                 res += str(a)\n>                 N -= MATCH_NUM[a]\n>                 break\n>     print(res)\n> main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```\n1\n```",
