Always executed.\n\n2. **Function Definitions:**\n   - `def main():` - Always executed.\n   - `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` - Always executed.\n   - `main()` - Always executed, since the script is run directly.\n\n3. **Reading Input:**\n   - `r, c, k = map(int, input().split())` - Executed, reads `3 3 3`.\n\n4. **Dictionary Initialization:**\n   - `v = dict()` - Always executed.\n\n5. **Reading Values:**\n   - `for _ in range(k):` - Loop executes three times (since `k = 3`).\n     - First iteration: Reads `1 1 2`, sets `v[(0, 0)] = 2`.\n     - Second iteration: Reads `2 2 3`, sets `v[(1, 1)] = 3`.\n     - Third iteration: Reads `3 3 4`, sets `v[(2, 2)] = 4`.\n\n6. **DP Array Initialization:**\n   - `dp = [[[0] * c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]` - Always executed.\n\n7. **Initial Value Check:**\n   - `if (0, 0) in v:` - True (since `v[(0, 0)] = 2`).\n   - `if v[(0, 0)] > 0:` - True (since `v[(0, 0)] = 2`).\n   - `dp[0][0][1] = v[(0, 0)]` - Executed.\n\n8. **Main Processing Loops:**\n   - `for i in range(r):` - Outer loop runs three times (`r = 3`).\n     - `for j in range(c):` - Inner loop runs three times (`c = 3`).\n\n9. **Inner Condition Checks and Updates:**\n   - i = 0:\n     - j = 0: No updates since `i = 0` and `j = 0`.\n     - j = 1 and j = 2: No updates since `v` does not contain these coordinates.\n   - i = 1:\n     - j = 0: No updates since `v` does not contain this coordinate.\n     - j = 1: Updates happen as this coordinate is in `v` and `v[(1, 1)] = 3`.\n     - j = 2: No updates since `v` does not contain this coordinate.\n   - i = 2:\n     - j = 0: No updates since `v` does not contain this coordinate.\n     - j = 1: No updates since `v` does not contain this coordinate.\n     - j = 2: Updates happen as this coordinate is in `v` and `v[(2, 2)] = 4`.\n\n10. **Final Calculation and Output:**\n    - `ans = 0` - Always executed.\n    - `for i in range(4):` - Loop runs four times.\n      - Updates `ans` with the maximum value found in `dp` for the last cell.\n    - `return print(ans)` - Executed, prints the final result.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input=sys.stdin.readline\n\n> def main():\n>     r, c, k = map(int, input().split())\n>     v = dict()\n>     for _ in range(k):\n>         ri, ci, a = map(int, input().split())\n>         ri -= 1\n>         ci -= 1\n>         v[(ri, ci)] = a\n\n>     dp = [[[0] * c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n>     if (0, 0) in v:\n>         if v[(0, 0)] > 0:\n>             dp[0][0][1] = v[(0, 0)]\n\n>     for i in range(r):\n>         for j in range(c):\n>             if i > 0:\n>                 if (i, j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i, j)] > 0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3, j + 1) + 1):\n>                             dp[1][i][j] = max(dp[1][i][j], dp[k][i -

The statement `import sys` and `input=sys.stdin.readline` will be covered.\n2. **Main Function Declaration**: The main function declaration `def main():` is always executed and will be covered.\n3. **Reading User Input**: The input statement `r,c,k=map(int,input().split())` will be executed. Since the input is `0 0 0`, `r`, `c`, and `k` will be set to 0.\n4. **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `v=dict()` will be initialized and the statement will be covered.\n5. **For Loop for Reading Additional Input**: The loop `for _ in range(k):` will not be executed since `k` is 0. Hence, this loop and its contents are not covered.\n6. **3D List Initialization**: The initialization of the 3D list `dp` with dimensions `[4][r][c]` will be executed, but since `r` and `c` are 0, it effectively initializes an empty list.\n7. **Checking Initial Position in Dictionary**: The if condition `if (0,0) in v:` will be checked, but it will not be satisfied since `v` is empty. Therefore, the nested if condition `if v[(0,0)]>0:` and `dp[0][0][1]=v[(0,0)]` will not be executed.\n8. **Nested Loops for Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The outer loop `for i in range(r):` and the nested loop `for j in range(c):` will not be executed since both `r` and `c` are 0.\n9. **Calculating the Maximum Value**: The loop `for i in range(4):` will iterate 4 times, and within this loop, the statement `ans=max(dp[i][r-1][c-1],ans)` will try to access `dp[i][-1][-1]`, which will raise an `IndexError` because the list `dp` is empty (due to `r` and `c` being 0).\n10. **Returning the Result**: The statement `return print(ans)` will not be executed due to the `IndexError`.\n11. **Main Function Call**: The statement `if __name__==\"__main__\": main()` is always executed and will be covered.\n\n### Final Code Coverage Based on Test Case and Execution Plan:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input=sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     r,c,k=map(int,input().split())\n>     v=dict()\n!     for _ in range(k):\n!         ri,ci,a=map(int,input().split())\n!         ri-=1\n!         ci-=1\n!         v[(ri,ci)]=a\n>     dp=[[[0]*c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n!     if (0,0) in v:\n!         if v[(0,0)]>0:\n!             dp[0][0][1]=v[(0,0)]\n!     for i in range(r):\n!         for j in range(c):\n!             if i>0:\n!                 if (i,j) in v:\n!                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n!                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n!                             dp[1][i][j]=max(dp[1][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j]+v[(i,j)])\n!                 for k in range(4):\n!                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j])\n!             if j>0:\n!                 if (i,j) in v:\n!                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n!                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n!                             if k>0:\n!                                 dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k-1][i][j-1]+v[(i,j)])\n!                 for k in range(4):\n!                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i][j-1])\n!     ans=0\n!     for i in range(4):\n!         ans=max(dp[i][r-1][c-1],ans)\n!     return print(ans)\n> if __name__==\"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### OUTPUT:\nError: IndexError - list index out of range.",

Additionally, if the code raises an exception, we will identify it.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution Plan:\n\n1. **Import Statement**: The import statement is always executed.\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   ```\n\n2. **Input Handling**: The input statement `input=sys.stdin.readline` is always executed.\n   ```python\n   input=sys.stdin.readline\n   ```\n\n3. **Main Function Definition**: The function definition is always executed.\n   ```python\n   def main():\n   ```\n\n4. **Reading Input Values**: The input values are read from stdin.\n   ```python\n       r,c,k=map(int,input().split())\n   ```\n   Given the test case input:\n   ```\n   2 2 2\n   1 1 0\n   1 2 1\n   1 1 1\n   1 1 1\n   ```\n   The values `r = 2`, `c = 2`, and `k = 2` will be read.\n\n5. **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `v` is initialized to store values.\n   ```python\n       v=dict()\n   ```\n\n6. **Reading Subsequent Input Values**: The next `k` lines are read to populate the dictionary `v`.\n   ```python\n       for _ in range(k):\n           ri,ci,a=map(int,input().split())\n           ri-=1\n           ci-=1\n           v[(ri,ci)]=a\n   ```\n   - First iteration: `ri = 1`, `ci = 1`, `a = 0` \u2192 `v[(0, 0)] = 0`\n   - Second iteration: `ri = 1`, `ci = 2`, `a = 1` \u2192 `v[(0, 1)] = 1`\n\n7. **3D List Initialization**: The 3D list `dp` is initialized.\n   ```python\n       dp=[[[0]*c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n   ```\n\n8. **Checking Initial Condition**: The initial condition is evaluated and updated in the `dp` list.\n   ```python\n       if (0,0) in v:\n           if v[(0,0)]>0:\n               dp[0][0][1]=v[(0,0)]\n   ```\n   - Since `v[(0,0)] = 0`, `v[(0,0)] > 0` is false, so `dp[0][0][1]` is not updated.\n\n9. **Nested Loops for DP Calculation**: The nested loops iterate over the dimensions of the grid, and the dynamic programming table `dp` is updated.\n   ```python\n       for i in range(r):\n           for j in range(c):\n               ...\n   ```\n\n10. **Row and Column Checks and DP Updates**:\n    - **Row Check**:\n      ```python\n               if i>0:\n                   if (i,j) in v:\n                       if v[(i,j)]>0:\n                           for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n                               dp[1][i][j]=max(dp[1][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j]+v[(i,j)])\n                   for k in range(4):\n                       dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j])\n      ```\n    - **Column Check**:\n      ```python\n               if j>0:\n                   if (i,j) in v:\n                       if v[(i,j)]>0:\n                           for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n                               if k>0:\n                                   dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k-1][i][j-1]+v[(i,j)])\n                   for k in range(4):\n                       dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i][j-1])\n      ```\n    - Here, the loops iterate over `i` from 0 to 1 and `j` from 0 to 1. The `dp` table updates based on the values in `v`.\n\n11. **Calculating the Final Answer**: The final answer is calculated by finding the maximum value in the last cell of the `dp` table.\n   ```python\n       ans=0\n       for i in range(4):\n           ans=max(dp[i][r-1][c-1],ans)\n   ```\n\n12. **Returning the Result**: The result is printed.\n   ```python\n       return print(ans)\n   ```\n\n13. **Main Function Call**: The main function is called.\n   ```python\n   if __name__==\"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input=sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     r,c,k=map(int,input().split())\n>     v=dict()\n>     for _ in range(k):\n>         ri,ci,a=map(int,input().split())\n>         ri-=1\n>         ci-=1\n>         v[(ri,ci)]=a\n>     dp=[[[0]*c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n>     if (0,0) in v:\n>         if v[(0,0)]>0:\n!             dp[0][0][1]=v[(0,0)]\n>     for i in range(r):\n>         for j in range(c):\n>             if i>0:\n>                 if (i,j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n>                             dp[1][i][j]=max(dp[1][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j]+v[(i,j)])\n>                 for k in range(4):\n>                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j])\n>             if j>0:\n>                 if (i,j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n>                             if k>0:\n>                                 dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k-1][i][j-1]+v[(i,j)])\n>                 for k in range(4):\n>                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i][j-1])\n>     ans=0\n>     for i in range(4):\n>         ans=max(dp[i][r-1][c-1],ans)\n>     return print(ans)\n> if __name__==\"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n```plaintext\n0\n```\n\nNo RuntimeError is raised in this case because the values are processed correctly within the logic of the program.",

The program will attempt to read the first line of input, which contains strings `\"a b c\"`. This will cause a `ValueError` when trying to convert these strings to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.\n2. Since a `ValueError` is raised, the program will terminate, and none of the subsequent lines within the `main` function will be executed.\n\n#### Test Case 2 Execution Plan:\n1. The program will read the first line of input `\"2 2 2\"` and parse it into integers `r=2`, `c=2`, `k=2`.\n2. It will then initialize an empty dictionary `v`.\n3. The program will proceed to read the next `k` lines of input and populate the dictionary `v`:\n   - `1 1 1` -> `v[(0, 0)] = 1`\n   - `2 2 2` -> `v[(1, 1)] = 2`\n4. It initializes the 3D list `dp` with dimensions `[4][2][2]`.\n5. The program checks if `(0, 0)` is in the dictionary `v` and updates `dp[0][0][1]` to `v[(0, 0)]`.\n6. It proceeds to loop through the grid dimensions `r` and `c`. However, when it attempts to access `v[(2, 2)]`, it will raise a `KeyError` as this key is not in the dictionary.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n\n#### Test Case 1 Coverage:\n```\n> import sys\n> input=sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     r,c,k=map(int,input().split())\n!     v=dict()\n!     for _ in range(k):\n!         ri,ci,a=map(int,input().split())\n!         ri-=1\n!         ci-=1\n!         v[(ri,ci)]=a\n!     dp=[[[0]*c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n!     if (0,0) in v:\n!         if v[(0,0)]>0:\n!             dp[0][0][1]=v[(0,0)]\n!     for i in range(r):\n!         for j in range(c):\n!             if i>0:\n!                 if (i,j) in v:\n!                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n!                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n!                             dp[1][i][j]=max(dp[1][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j]+v[(i,j)])\n!                 for k in range(4):\n!                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j])\n!             if j>0:\n!                 if (i,j) in v:\n!                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n!                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n!                             if k>0:\n!                                 dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k-1][i][j-1]+v[(i,j)])\n!                 for k in range(4):\n!                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i][j-1])\n!     ans=0\n!     for i in range(4):\n!         ans=max(dp[i][r-1][c-1],ans)\n!     return print(ans)\n> if __name__==\"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n**OUTPUT:** `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'`\n\n#### Test Case 2 Coverage:\n```\n> import sys\n> input=sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     r,c,k=map(int,input().split())\n>     v=dict()\n>     for _ in range(k):\n>         ri,ci,a=map(int,input().split())\n>         ri-=1\n>         ci-=1\n>         v[(ri,ci)]=a\n>     dp=[[[0]*c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n>     if (0,0) in v:\n>         if v[(0,0)]>0:\n>             dp[0][0][1]=v[(0,0)]\n>     for i in range(r):\n>         for j in range(c):\n>             if i>0:\n>                 if (i,j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n>                             dp[1][i][j]=max(dp[1][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j]+v[(i,j)])\n>                 for k in range(4):\n>                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i-1][j])\n>             if j>0:\n>                 if (i,j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i,j)]>0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3,j+1)+1):\n>                             if k>0:\n>                                 dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k-1][i][j-1]+v[(i,j)])\n>                 for k in range(4):\n>                     dp[k][i][j]=max(dp[k][i][j],dp[k][i][j-1])\n>     ans=0\n>     for i in range(4):\n>         ans=max(dp[i][r-1][c-1],ans)\n>     return print(ans)\n> if __name__==\"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n**OUTPUT:** `KeyError: (2, 2)`",

            "covered_code": "To determine the code coverage of the given Python program with the specified test case, we will follow a detailed step-by-step plan of execution. Note that this specific test case will raise an exception due to its incorrect format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan for Execution:\n\n1. **Import Statements:**\n   - `import sys` is always executed.\n   - `input = sys.stdin.readline` is always executed.\n   \n2. **Main Function Declaration:**\n   - The main function declaration `def main():` is always executed.\n\n3. **Reading Input:**\n   - The first input line `r, c, k = map(int, input().split())` expects three space-separated integers. Given the test case `3 3 3`, this line will be executed successfully.\n   \n4. **Dictionary Initialization:**\n   - `v = dict()` is executed, initializing an empty dictionary.\n\n5. **Reading Multiple Lines of Input:**\n   - The `for` loop `for _ in range(k):` will iterate `k` times (3 times in this case).\n\n6. **Processing Each Line of Input:**\n   - For the first line `1 1 2`, `ri, ci, a = map(int, input().split())` will be executed successfully.\n     - Adjusting the indices: `ri -= 1` and `ci -= 1` are executed.\n     - The dictionary update `v[(ri, ci)] = a` is executed.\n   - The same steps will be repeated for the second line `2 2 3` and the third line `3 3 4`.\n\n7. **DP Array Initialization:**\n   - `dp = [[[0] * c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]` initializes a 4-dimensional list of zeros, and this statement is executed.\n\n8. **Checking Initial Condition:**\n   - The `if (0, 0) in v:` statement checks the initial condition. This will be executed.\n   - The nested `if v[(0, 0)] > 0:` will not be executed because `(0, 0)` is not in `v`.\n\n9. **Nested Loops for DP Table Update:**\n   - The outer loops `for i in range(r):` and `for j in range(c):` will be executed for each cell in the grid.\n   - The inner conditions and updates will be executed based on the values of `i`, `j`, and the presence of `(i, j)` in the dictionary `v`.\n\n10. **Calculating the Final Answer:**\n    - The final loop `for i in range(4):` and the statement `ans = max(dp[i][r - 1][c - 1], ans)` calculate the answer, and this will be executed.\n\n11. **Returning the Result:**\n    - The final statement `return print(ans)` prints the result and is executed.\n\n12. **Main Function Call:**\n    - The main function call `if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()` is executed.\n\n### Execution with the Given Test Case:\n\nThe test case input `3 3 3\\n1 1 2\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 4\\n0 0 0 0\\n` will cause a `ValueError` because the fourth line `0 0 0 0` contains four integers instead of three. Thus, the program will raise an exception at this point.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the code coverage will be as follows:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     r, c, k = map(int, input().split())\n>     v = dict()\n>     for _ in range(k):\n>         ri, ci, a = map(int, input().split())\n>         ri -= 1\n>         ci -= 1\n>         v[(ri, ci)] = a\n>     dp = [[[0] * c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n>     if (0, 0) in v:\n>         if v[(0, 0)] > 0:\n!             dp[0][0][1] = v[(0, 0)]\n>     for i in range(r):\n>         for j in range(c):\n>             if i > 0:\n>                 if (i, j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i, j)] > 0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3, j + 1) + 1):\n>                             dp[1][i][j] = max(dp[1][i][j], dp[k][i - 1][j] + v[(i, j)])\n>                 for k in range(4):\n>                     dp[k][i][j] = max(dp[k][i][j], dp[k][i - 1][j])\n>             if j > 0:\n>                 if (i, j) in v:\n>                     if v[(i, j)] > 0:\n>                         for k in range(min(3, j + 1) + 1):\n>                             if k > 0:\n>                                 dp[k][i][j] = max(dp[k][i][j], dp[k - 1][i][j - 1] + v[(i, j)])\n>                 for k in range(4):\n>                     dp[k][i][j] = max(dp[k][i][j], dp[k][i][j - 1])\n>     ans = 0\n>     for i in range(4):\n>         ans = max(dp[i][r - 1][c - 1], ans)\n>     return print(ans)\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n\n```python\nValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)\n```\n\nThe error occurs when trying to unpack four values into three variables in the line `ri, ci, a = map(int, input().split())`.",

Therefore, the program will terminate, and no further steps are performed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import sys\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n\n> def main():\n>     r, c, k = map(int, input().split())\n!     v = dict()\n!     for _ in range(k):\n!         ri, ci, a = map(int, input().split())\n!         ri -= 1\n!         ci -= 1\n!         v[(ri, ci)] = a\n!     dp = [[[0] * c for _ in range(r)] for i in range(4)]\n!     if (0, 0) in v:\n!         if v[(0, 0)] > 0:\n!             dp[0][0][1] = v[(0, 0)]\n!     for i in range(r):\n!         for j in range(c):\n!             if i > 0:\n!                 if (i, j) in v:\n!                     if v[(i, j)] > 0:\n!                         for k in range(min(3, j + 1) + 1):\n!                             dp[1][i][j] = max(dp[1][i][j], dp[k][i - 1][j] + v[(i, j)])\n!                 for k in range(4):\n!                     dp[k][i][j] = max(dp[k][i][j], dp[k][i - 1][j])\n!             if j > 0:\n!                 if (i, j) in v:\n!                     if v[(i, j)] > 0:\n!                         for k in range(min(3, j + 1) + 1):\n!                             if k > 0:\n!                                 dp[k][i][j] = max(dp[k][i][j], dp[k - 1][i][j - 1] + v[(i, j)])\n!                 for k in range(4):\n!                     dp[k][i][j] = max(dp[k][i][j], dp[k][i][j - 1])\n!     ans = 0\n!     for i in range(4):\n!         ans = max(dp[i][r - 1][c - 1], ans)\n!     return print(ans)\n\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\nError: ValueError = invalid literal for int() with base 10: '-2'\n```",
