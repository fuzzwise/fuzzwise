Given `a_list`, `kind` will be `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`.\n7. **First If Condition**: The condition `if len(kind) not in (1, 2, 3):` is checked. Since `len(kind)` is `5`, this condition is true, and the block is executed. The statement `print(\"No\")` is executed and \"No\" is printed. The program then returns, and no further lines in `main()` are executed.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n```python\n> import sys\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     n = int(input())\n>     a_list = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n>     kind = set(a_list)\n>     if len(kind) not in (1, 2, 3):\n>         print(\"No\")\n>         return\n!     if len(kind) == 1 and 0 in kind:\n!         print(\"Yes\")\n!         return\n!     elif len(kind) == 3:\n!         if n % 3 != 0 or len(set([a_list.count(k) for k in kind])) != 1:\n!             print(\"No\")\n!             return\n!         kind = list(kind)\n!     else:\n!         a, b = kind\n!         a_c, b_c = a_list.count(a), a_list.count(b)\n!         if 0 not in kind or abs(a_c - b_c) > 1:\n!             print(\"No\")\n!             return\n!         if a == 0:\n!             if a_c > b_c:\n!                 print(\"No\")\n!                 return\n!             kind = [b, a, b]\n!         else:\n!             if b_c > a_c:\n!                 print(\"No\")\n!                 return\n!             kind = [a, b, a]\n!     kind.extend([kind[0], kind[-1]])\n!     for i in range(3):\n!         if kind[i] != kind[i - 1] ^ kind[i + 1]:\n!             print(\"No\")\n!             return\n!     print(\"Yes\")\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\nNo\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The program exits early due to the condition `if len(kind) not in (1, 2, 3)`, which is true for the given input.\n- Consequently, many parts of the code are not executed.\n\nThis plan and coverage prediction should provide a clear understanding of which parts of the code are covered and which are not based on the given test case.",

Statement `import sys` is covered.\n   - Statement `input = sys.stdin.readline` is also covered.\n\n2. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function definition `def main():` is covered since the function is called.\n  \n3. **Main Function Execution**:\n   - `n = int(input())` is executed to read the first input line. `n` is set to 2.\n   - `a_list = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` is executed to read the second input line. `a_list` is set to `[0, 1]`.\n   - `kind = set(a_list)` is executed. `kind` is set to `{0, 1}`.\n\n4. **Branch Conditions**:\n   - `if len(kind) not in (1, 2, 3):` is executed. This condition is false, so the print statement `print(\"No\")` and `return` are not executed.\n   - `if len(kind) == 1 and 0 in kind:` is executed. This condition is false, so the print statement `print(\"Yes\")` and `return` are not executed.\n   - `elif len(kind) == 3:` is executed. This condition is false, so the following block within this condition is not executed.\n\n5. **Else Block**:\n   - The else block `else:` is executed.\n   - `a, b = kind` is executed. `a` is set to 0, `b` is set to 1.\n   - `a_c, b_c = a_list.count(a), a_list.count(b)` is executed. `a_c` is set to 1, `b_c` is set to 1.\n   - `if 0 not in kind or abs(a_c - b_c) > 1:` is executed. This condition is false, so the print statement `print(\"No\")` and `return` are not executed.\n   - `if a == 0:` is executed. This condition is true.\n     - `if a_c > b_c:` is executed. This condition is false, so the print statement `print(\"No\")` and `return` are not executed.\n     - `kind = [b, a, b]` is executed. `kind` is set to `[1, 0, 1]`.\n\n6. **Further Execution**:\n   - `kind.extend([kind[0], kind[-1]])` is executed. `kind` is set to `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]`.\n   - `for i in range(3):` is executed, iterating three times with `i = 0, 1, 2`.\n     - The condition `if kind[i] != kind[i - 1] ^ kind[i + 1]:` is checked for each `i`.\n       - For `i = 0`, `kind[0] != kind[-1] ^ kind[1]`, i.e., `1 != 1 ^ 0`, which is false.\n       - For `i = 1`, `kind[1] != kind[0] ^ kind[2]`, i.e., `0 != 1 ^ 1`, which is true. Thus, `print(\"No\")` is executed and `return` is executed.\n\n### Final Code Coverage:\n```python\n> import sys\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n\n> def main():\n>     n = int(input())\n>     a_list = [int(i) for i in input().split()]\n>     kind = set(a_list)\n>     if len(kind) not in (1, 2, 3):\n!         print(\"No\")\n!         return\n>     if len(kind) == 1 and 0 in kind:\n!         print(\"Yes\")\n!         return\n>     elif len(kind) == 3:\n>         if n % 3 != 0 or len(set([a_list.count(k) for k in kind])) != 1:\n!             print(\"No\")\n!             return\n>         kind = list(kind)\n>     else:\n>         a, b = kind\n>         a_c, b_c = a_list.count(a), a_list.count(b)\n>         if 0 not in kind or abs(a_c - b_c) > 1:\n!             print(\"No\")\n!             return\n>         if a == 0:\n>             if a_c > b_c:\n!                 print(\"No\")\n!                 return\n>             kind = [b, a, b]\n>         else:\n!             if b_c > a_c:\n!                 print(\"No\")\n!                 return\n!             kind = [a, b, a]\n>     kind.extend([kind[0], kind[-1]])\n>     for i in range(3):\n>         if kind[i] != kind[i - 1] ^ kind[i + 1]:\n>             print(\"No\")\n>             return\n!     print(\"Yes\")\n\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\nNo\n```",
