Statements `nv, ne, r = map(int, input().split())` and dictionary comprehensions for `in_edges` and `out_edges` will be covered.\n\n3. **While Loop for Reading Edges**: Since `ne` is initially `3`, the loop will execute 3 times. Each iteration of the loop will execute the statements inside it.\n   \n4. **Function Definition (`chu_liu_edmond`)**: The function definition is always executed when the function is defined in the code.\n\n5. **Function Call**: Always executed. `print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))` will be covered.\n\n6. **Inside `chu_liu_edmond` Function**:\n   - **Variable Initialization and Dictionary Comprehensions**: Always executed.\n   - **First For-Loop**: Loop over `vertices`. Since `vertices` is `{0, 1, 2}`, it will execute 3 times.\n   - **If Condition Inside First For-Loop**: `if t == r` will be checked for each vertex.\n   - **Finding Minimum Incoming Edge**: For each vertex, executed if `t != r`.\n   - **Second While-Loop**: Loop over `queue`. Executed if `queue` is not empty.\n   - **First For-Loop for Cycles Detection**: Loop over `vertices`. Executed for each vertex.\n   - **While-Loop for Detecting Cycles**: Executed if `i not in visited`.\n   - **Nested While-Loop for Cycle Vertex Collection**: Executed if a cycle is detected.\n   - **If No Cycles Detected**: Return `total_cost`.\n   - **Second For-Loop for Handling Cycles**: Executed if cycles are detected.\n   - **Recursive Call**: Executed if cycles are detected.\n\n7. **Print Statement**: Always executed if the function returns a value.\n\n#### Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import heapq\n> nv, ne, r = map(int, input().split())\n> in_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> out_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> while ne:\n>     s, t, w = map(int, input().split())\n>     in_edges[t].add((w, s))\n>     out_edges[s].add((w, t))\n>     ne -= 1\n> def chu_liu_edmond(vertices):\n>     global in_edges, out_edges, nv, r\n>     total_cost = 0\n>     prev_v = {v: None for v in vertices}\n>     next_vs = {v: set() for v in vertices}\n>     for t in vertices:\n>         if t == r:\n>             continue\n>         min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])\n>         total_cost += min_in_w\n>         prev_v[t] = min_in_s\n>         next_vs[min_in_s].add(t)\n>     visited = {r}\n>     queue = set(next_vs[r])\n>     while queue:\n>         t = queue.pop()\n>         visited.add(t)\n>         queue.update(next_vs[t])\n>     cycles = []\n>     for i in vertices:\n>         if i in visited:\n>             continue\n>         cycle_vertices = set()\n>         while i not in visited:\n>             visited.add(i)\n>             cycle_vertices.add(i)\n>             i = prev_v[i]\n>         if i not in cycle_vertices:\n>             continue\n>         cycle_vertices, j = {i}, i\n>         while prev_v[j] != i:\n>             cycle_vertices.add(j)\n>             j = prev_v[j]\n>         cycles.append(cycle_vertices)\n>     if not cycles:\n>         return total_cost\n>     for cycle in cycles:\n>         vertices.add(nv)\n>         vertices -= cycle\n>         for v in cycle:\n>             for w, t in out_edges[v]:\n>                 if t not in cycle:\n>                     out_edges[nv].add((w, t))\n>                     in_edges[t].remove((w, v))\n>                     in_edges[t].add((w, nv))\n>             for w, s in in_edges[v]:\n>                 if s not in cycle:\n>                     new_w = w - min(in_edges[v])[0]\n>                     in_edges[nv].add((new_w, s))\n>                     out_edges[s].remove((w, v))\n>                     out_edges[s].add((new_w, v))\n>         nv += 1\n>     return chu_liu_edmond(vertices)\n> print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))\n```\n\n#### Test Case Input Execution:\n\nGiven the input `3 3 0`, the program will read 3 vertices, 3 edges, and root 0. The edges will be read as:\n\n1. `0 1 1`\n2. `1 2 2`\n3. `2 0 3`\n\nThe function will be called with `vertices = {0, 1, 2}`, and the algorithm will execute as planned.\n\n**Output**: The output will be the total cost of the minimum spanning arborescence (MSA), which is `6` in this case.",

Given `ne = 1` from the input `0 1 0`, the loop will execute once.\n   - The loop statements:\n     - `s, t, w = map(int, input().split())` is covered.\n     - `in_edges[t].add((w, s))` is covered.\n     - `out_edges[s].add((w, t))` is covered.\n     - `ne -= 1` is covered.\n\n4. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function definition `def chu_liu_edmond(vertices):` is always executed.\n   - All statements within the function are initially not covered until the function is called and executed.\n\n5. **Function Call**:\n   - The function call `print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))` is executed.\n   - `vertices = set(range(nv))` will be `{0}` given `nv = 1`.\n\n6. **Function Execution**:\n   - Inside the function `chu_liu_edmond`:\n     - `total_cost = 0` is covered.\n     - `prev_v = {v: None for v in vertices}` is covered.\n     - `next_vs = {v: set() for v in vertices}` is covered.\n     - The for loop `for t in vertices:` will iterate over the set `{0}`.\n       - For `t = 0`:\n         - The if condition `if t == r:` is true, so `continue` is executed, skipping further statements in the loop for `t = 0`.\n\n7. **ZeroDivisionError Exception**:\n   - The next part of the function `min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])` is not executed due to the continue statement.\n   - Since the function proceeds without entering the loop body (because of `continue`), no further statements inside the for loop are executed.\n\n8. **End of Function Execution**:\n   - Since the function does not encounter any cycles or edges (due to `nv`, `ne`, and `r` being zero or minimal), it directly returns `total_cost` which is `0`.\n\n### Predicted Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import heapq\n> nv, ne, r = map(int, input().split())\n> in_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> out_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> while ne:\n>     s, t, w = map(int, input().split())\n>     in_edges[t].add((w, s))\n>     out_edges[s].add((w, t))\n>     ne -= 1\n> def chu_liu_edmond(vertices):\n>     global in_edges, out_edges, nv, r\n>     total_cost = 0\n>     prev_v = {v: None for v in vertices}\n>     next_vs = {v: set() for v in vertices}\n>     for t in vertices:\n>         if t == r:\n>             continue\n!         min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])\n!         total_cost += min_in_w\n!         prev_v[t] = min_in_s\n!         next_vs[min_in_s].add(t)\n!     visited = {r}\n!     queue = set(next_vs[r])\n!     while queue:\n!         t = queue.pop()\n!         visited.add(t)\n!         queue.update(next_vs[t])\n!     cycles = []\n!     for i in vertices:\n!         if i in visited:\n!             continue\n!         cycle_vertices = set()\n!         while i not in visited:\n!             visited.add(i)\n!             cycle_vertices.add(i)\n!             i = prev_v[i]\n!         if i not in cycle_vertices:\n!             continue\n!         cycle_vertices, j = {i}, i\n!         while prev_v[j] != i:\n!             cycle_vertices.add(j)\n!             j = prev_v[j]\n!         cycles.append(cycle_vertices)\n!     if not cycles:\n!         return total_cost\n!     for cycle in cycles:\n!         vertices.add(nv)\n!         vertices -= cycle\n!         for v in cycle:\n!             for w, t in out_edges[v]:\n!                 if t not in cycle:\n!                     out_edges[nv].add((w, t))\n!                     in_edges[t].remove((w, v))\n!                     in_edges[t].add((w, nv))\n!             for w, s in in_edges[v]:\n!                 if s not in cycle:\n!                     new_w = w - min(in_edges[v])[0]\n!                     in_edges[nv].add((new_w, s))\n!                     out_edges[s].remove((w, v))\n!                     out_edges[s].add((new_w, v))\n!         nv += 1\n!     return chu_liu_edmond(vertices)\n> print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))\n```\n\n### Runtime Exception Raised:\n- The code does not raise a `ZeroDivisionError` in the execution path given the test inputs directly. The function `chu_liu_edmond` will return `0` because no edges are processed, and the problematic line `min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])` is skipped due to the `continue` statement.\n  \nHowever, if we had more complex inputs causing the `min` function to be called on an empty set, it could raise a `ValueError` for attempting to get the minimum of an empty sequence.",

However, both iterations will result in `ZeroDivisionError` when `min(in_edges[t])` is called.\n   - Statements inside the loop `s, t, w = map(int, input().split())`, `in_edges[t].add((w, s))`, `out_edges[s].add((w, t))`, and `ne -= 1` will be executed.\n\n4. **Function Declaration**\n   - Declaring the function `chu_liu_edmond(vertices)` is always executed.\n\n5. **Function Call**\n   - The function call `print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))` will be executed.\n   - Since `nv` is 0, the set `set(range(nv))` will be an empty set.\n\n6. **Function Execution**\n   - Inside the function `chu_liu_edmond`, the statements up to the for loop `for t in vertices:` will be executed.\n   - Since `vertices` is an empty set, the for loop won't be executed.\n   - The while loop `while queue:` and the subsequent code won't be executed since `queue` is empty.\n   - The cycles handling code won\u2019t be executed as there are no cycles identified.\n   - The function will return `total_cost`, which is 0 because no iterations or any calculations have been done.\n\n### Final Code Coverage\n\n```python\n> import heapq\n> nv, ne, r = map(int, input().split())\n> in_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> out_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> while ne:\n>     s, t, w = map(int, input().split())\n>     in_edges[t].add((w, s))\n>     out_edges[s].add((w, t))\n>     ne -= 1\n> def chu_liu_edmond(vertices):\n>     global in_edges, out_edges, nv, r\n>     total_cost = 0\n>     prev_v = {v: None for v in vertices}\n>     next_vs = {v: set() for v in vertices}\n>     for t in vertices:\n!         if t == r:\n!             continue\n!         min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])\n!         total_cost += min_in_w\n!         prev_v[t] = min_in_s\n!         next_vs[min_in_s].add(t)\n>     visited = {r}\n!     queue = set(next_vs[r])\n!     while queue:\n!         t = queue.pop()\n!         visited.add(t)\n!         queue.update(next_vs[t])\n>     cycles = []\n>     for i in vertices:\n!         if i in visited:\n!             continue\n!         cycle_vertices = set()\n!         while i not in visited:\n!             visited.add(i)\n!             cycle_vertices.add(i)\n!             i = prev_v[i]\n!         if i not in cycle_vertices:\n!             continue\n!         cycle_vertices, j = {i}, i\n!         while prev_v[j] != i:\n!             cycle_vertices.add(j)\n!             j = prev_v[j]\n!         cycles.append(cycle_vertices)\n!     if not cycles:\n!         return total_cost\n!     for cycle in cycles:\n!         vertices.add(nv)\n!         vertices -= cycle\n!         for v in cycle:\n!             for w, t in out_edges[v]:\n!                 if t not in cycle:\n!                     out_edges[nv].add((w, t))\n!                     in_edges[t].remove((w, v))\n!                     in_edges[t].add((w, nv))\n!             for w, s in in_edges[v]:\n!                 if s not in cycle:\n!                     new_w = w - min(in_edges[v])[0]\n!                     in_edges[nv].add((new_w, s))\n!                     out_edges[s].remove((w, v))\n!                     out_edges[s].add((new_w, v))\n!         nv += 1\n!     return chu_liu_edmond(vertices)\n> print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))\n```\n\n### Runtime Exception\n\nThis test case will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because the input values for `nv`, `ne`, and `r` are all zero, causing a division by zero in the line `min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])`.\n\n**Output:**\n```plaintext\nError: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n```",

This will cause logical issues later in the code.\n\n4. **Creating Edge Dictionaries**:\n   - Statements `in_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}` and `out_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}` will be executed.\n   - Since `nv` is `1`, `in_edges` and `out_edges` will be `{0: set()}`.\n\n5. **Reading Edge Data**:\n   - The `while ne:` loop will execute since `ne` is `1`.\n   - Statement `s, t, w = map(int, input().split())` will be executed.\n   - The second part of the test input is `0 0 0`, so `s`, `t`, and `w` will all be `0`.\n   - Statements `in_edges[t].add((w, s))` and `out_edges[s].add((w, t))` will be executed.\n   - As a result, `in_edges` will be `{0: {(0, 0)}}` and `out_edges` will be `{0: {(0, 0)}}`.\n   - Statement `ne -= 1` will be executed, and `ne` becomes `0`, ending the loop.\n\n6. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function `def chu_liu_edmond(vertices):` declaration will be executed.\n\n7. **Initial Function Call**:\n   - Statement `print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))` will be executed.\n   - Since `nv` is `1`, `set(range(nv))` will be `{0}`.\n\n### Expected Runtime Behavior:\n- Given that `nv` is `1`, the function `chu_liu_edmond` will be called with `vertices = {0}`.\n- The function will execute some initial setup but will encounter logical issues since `nv` is `1` and there are no valid vertices to process further.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n```python\n> import heapq\n> nv, ne, r = map(int, input().split())\n> in_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> out_edges = {v: set() for v in range(nv)}\n> while ne:\n>     s, t, w = map(int, input().split())\n>     in_edges[t].add((w, s))\n>     out_edges[s].add((w, t))\n>     ne -= 1\n> def chu_liu_edmond(vertices):\n>     global in_edges, out_edges, nv, r\n>     total_cost = 0\n>     prev_v = {v: None for v in vertices}\n>     next_vs = {v: set() for v in vertices}\n>     for t in vertices:\n>         if t == r:\n>             continue\n>         min_in_w, min_in_s = min(in_edges[t])\n>         total_cost += min_in_w\n>         prev_v[t] = min_in_s\n>         next_vs[min_in_s].add(t)\n>     visited = {r}\n>     queue = set(next_vs[r])\n>     while queue:\n>         t = queue.pop()\n>         visited.add(t)\n>         queue.update(next_vs[t])\n>     cycles = []\n>     for i in vertices:\n>         if i in visited:\n>             continue\n>         cycle_vertices = set()\n>         while i not in visited:\n>             visited.add(i)\n>             cycle_vertices.add(i)\n>             i = prev_v[i]\n>         if i not in cycle_vertices:\n>             continue\n>         cycle_vertices, j = {i}, i\n>         while prev_v[j] != i:\n>             cycle_vertices.add(j)\n>             j = prev_v[j]\n>         cycles.append(cycle_vertices)\n>     if not cycles:\n>         return total_cost\n!     for cycle in cycles:\n!         vertices.add(nv)\n!         vertices -= cycle\n!         for v in cycle:\n!             for w, t in out_edges[v]:\n!                 if t not in cycle:\n!                     out_edges[nv].add((w, t))\n!                     in_edges[t].remove((w, v))\n!                     in_edges[t].add((w, nv))\n!             for w, s in in_edges[v]:\n!                 if s not in cycle:\n!                     new_w = w - min(in_edges[v])[0]\n!                     in_edges[nv].add((new_w, s))\n!                     out_edges[s].remove((w, v))\n!                     out_edges[s].add((new_w, v))\n!         nv += 1\n!     return chu_liu_edmond(vertices)\n> print(chu_liu_edmond(set(range(nv))))\n```\n\n### Output:\nThe program will raise a `ValueError` because the `min()` function will be called on an empty sequence when the function attempts to find the minimum incoming edge weight for vertex `0`, which is not valid in this context.",
