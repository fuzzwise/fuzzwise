`import sys`\n   - `from collections import deque`\n   - `from bisect import bisect_left`\n\n2. **Reading Input:**\n   - `N, M = map(int, input().split())`\n\n3. **Initialization:**\n   - `tate = []`\n   - `yoko = []`\n   - `X = set()`\n   - `Y = set()`\n\n4. **First Loop (Reading N lines):**\n   - `for _ in range(N):`\n     - `A, B, C = map(int, readline().split())`\n     - `X.add(A)`\n     - `X.add(B)`\n     - `Y.add(C)`\n     - `tate.append((C, A, B))`\n\n5. **Second Loop (Reading M lines):**\n   - `for _ in range(M):`\n     - `D, E, F = map(int, readline().split())`\n     - `X.add(D)`\n     - `Y.add(E)`\n     - `Y.add(F)`\n     - `yoko.append((D, E, F))`\n\n6. **Sorting and Length Calculation:**\n   - `X = sorted(list(X))`\n   - `Y = sorted(list(Y))`\n   - `H = len(X)`\n   - `W = len(Y)`\n\n7. **Index Mapping:**\n   - `ix = {}`\n   - `for i, x in enumerate(X):`\n     - `ix[x] = i`\n   - `jy = {}`\n   - `for j, y in enumerate(Y):`\n     - `jy[y] = j`\n\n8. **Grid Initialization:**\n   - `grid = [[15] * W for _ in range(H)]`\n\n9. **First Nested Loop (Processing tate):**\n   - `for c, a, b in tate:`\n     - `ia = ix[a]`\n     - `ib = ix[b]`\n     - `jc = jy[c]`\n     - `for i in range(ia, ib):`\n       - `grid[i][jc - 1] &= 15 - (1 << 1)`\n       - `grid[i][jc] &= 15 - (1 << 3)`\n\n10. **Second Nested Loop (Processing yoko):**\n    -

(1 << 0)`\n\n11. **Deque Initialization and Path Setup:**\n    - `q = deque()`\n    - `x0 = bisect_left(X, 0) - (0 not in ix)`\n    - `y0 = bisect_left(Y, 0) - (0 not in jy)`\n    - `path = [[True] * W for _ in range(H)]`\n    - `path[x0][y0] = False`\n    - `q.append((x0, y0))`\n    - `direction = ((-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1))`\n    - `cnt = 0`\n\n12. **While Loop for BFS-like Traversal:**\n    - `while q:`\n      - `x, y = q.popleft()`\n      - `cnt += (X[x + 1] - X[x]) * (Y[y + 1] - Y[y])`\n      - `for i, (dx, dy) in enumerate(direction):`\n        - `if grid[x][y] & (1 << i):`\n          - `nx = x + dx`\n          - `ny = y + dy`\n          - `if 0 <= nx < H - 1 and 0 <= ny < W - 1:`\n            - `if path[nx][ny]:`\n              - `path[nx][ny] = False`\n              - `q.append((nx, ny))`\n          - `else:`\n            - `print('INF')`\n            - `exit()`\n\n13. **Final Print Statement:**\n    - `print(cnt)`\n\n### Code Coverage Based on Test Case:\n\n```python\n> def main():\n>     import sys\n>     readline = sys.stdin.readline\n>     from collections import deque\n>     from bisect import bisect_left\n>     N, M = map(int, input().split())\n>     tate = []\n>     yoko = []\n>     X = set()\n>     Y = set()\n>     for _ in range(N):\n>         A, B, C = map(int, readline().split())\n>         X.add(A)\n>         X.add(B)\n>         Y.add(C)\n>         tate.append((C, A, B))\n>     for _ in range(M):\n>         D, E, F = map(int, readline().split())\n>         X.add(D)\n>         Y.add(E)\n>         Y.add(F)\n>         yoko.append((D, E, F))\n>     X = sorted(list(X))\n>     Y = sorted(list(Y))\n>     H = len(X)\n>     W = len(Y)\n>     ix = {}\n>     for i, x in enumerate(X):\n>         ix[x] = i\n>     jy = {}\n>     for j, y in enumerate(Y):\n>         jy[y] = j\n>     grid = [[15] * W for _ in range(H)]\n>     for c, a, b in tate:\n>         ia = ix[a]\n>         ib = ix[b]\n>         jc = jy[c]\n>         for i in range(ia, ib):\n>             grid[i][jc -

Based on the test case and the program's logic, we will determine the code coverage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution Plan\n\n1. **Import Statements**:\n   - Import statements are always executed. Statements `import sys`, `from collections import deque`, and `from bisect import bisect_left` will be covered.\n\n2. **Reading Input**:\n   - The statement `N, M = map(int, input().split())` is executed, reading `N` and `M` from the input. For the given test case, `N` and `M` will both be `0`.\n\n3. **Initialization of Lists and Sets**:\n   - The statements `tate = []`, `yoko = []`, `X = set()`, and `Y = set()` are executed.\n\n4. **Reading `N` Lines for `tate`**:\n   - Since `N` is `0`, the for loop `for _ in range(N):` will not execute, and thus the statements inside this loop will not be covered.\n\n5. **Reading `M` Lines for `yoko`**:\n   - Since `M` is `0`, the for loop `for _ in range(M):` will not execute, and thus the statements inside this loop will not be covered.\n\n6. **Sorting and Length Calculations**:\n   - The statements `X = sorted(list(X))`, `Y = sorted(list(Y))`, `H = len(X)`, and `W = len(Y)` will be executed. Since `X` and `Y` are empty sets, `H` and `W` will both be `0`.\n\n7. **Creating Dictionaries `ix` and `jy`**:\n   - The statements `ix = {}` and `jy = {}` are executed.\n   - The for loops `for i, x in enumerate(X):` and `for j, y in enumerate(Y):` will not execute because `X` and `Y` are empty.\n\n8. **Creating the Grid**:\n   - The statement `grid = [[15] * W for _ in range(H)]` will be executed, resulting in an empty grid since `H` and `W` are `0`.\n\n9. **Processing `tate` and `yoko`**:\n   - The for loops `for c, a, b in tate:` and `for d, e, f in yoko:` will not execute because `tate` and `yoko` are empty.\n\n10. **Setting Up BFS**:\n    - The statement `q = deque()` is executed.\n    - The statements `x0 = bisect_left(X, 0) - (0 not in ix)` and `y0 = bisect_left(Y, 0) - (0 not in jy)` are executed. Since `X` and `Y` are empty, `x0` and `y0` will be `-1`.\n\n11. **Path Initialization and BFS Execution**:\n    - The statement `path = [[True] * W for _ in range(H)]` will result in an empty path grid.\n    - The statement `path[x0][y0] = False` will raise an `IndexError` because `x0` and `y0` are `-1`.\n\n### Code Coverage\n\nBased on the above execution plan, here is the code coverage for the given Python program:\n\n```\n> def main():\n>     import sys\n>     readline = sys.stdin.readline\n>     from collections import deque\n>     from bisect import bisect_left\n>     N, M = map(int, input().split())\n>     tate = []\n>     yoko = []\n>     X = set()\n>     Y = set()\n!     for _ in range(N):\n!
