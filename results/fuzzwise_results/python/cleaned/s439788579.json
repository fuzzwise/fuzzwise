The function call is always executed.\n    ```python\n    > def main():\n    > if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    >     main()\n    ```\n\n4. **Reading Initial Inputs**: The input values `n`, `m`, `k` are read from the input stream.\n    ```python\n    >     n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n    ```\n\n5. **Initialization of the `root` Array**: The `root` array is initialized with zeros.\n    ```python\n    >     root = numpy.array([numpy.zeros(n) for i in range(n)])\n    ```\n\n6. **Setting Diagonal Elements of `root`**: The diagonal elements of `root` are set to 2.\n    ```python\n    >     for i in range(n):\n    >         root[i][i] = 2\n    ```\n\n7. **Reading and Setting Edges**: The edges are read and set in the `root` array.\n    ```python\n    >     for i in range(m):\n    >         a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    >         root[a-1][b-1] = 1\n    >         root[b-1][a-1] = 1\n    ```\n\n8. **Reading and Setting Forbidden Pairs**: The forbidden pairs are read and set in the `root` array.\n    ```python\n    >     for i in range(k):\n    >         a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    >         root[a-1][b-1] = -100\n    >         root[b-1][a-1] = -100\n    ```\n\n9. **Initialization of Queues and Arrays**: Initialization of `toVis`, `Visted`, `checkOK`, `OK`, `checkVis`, and `checkVinit`.\n    ```python\n    >     toVis = queue.Queue()\n    >     Visted = []\n    >     checkOK = numpy.zeros(n)\n    >     OK = {}\n    >     checkVis = numpy.zeros(n)\n    >     checkVinit = numpy.zeros(n)\n    ```\n\n10. **Main Loop for Processing Nodes**: The main loop processes each node.\n    ```python\n    >     for i in range(n):\n    ```\n\n11. **Skipping Already Processed Nodes**: Skip nodes that are already processed.\n    ```python\n    >         if checkOK[i] == 5:\n    >             continue\n    ```\n\n12. **Initialization for BFS**: Initialize BFS-related variables.\n    ```python\n    >         checkVis = checkVinit\n    >         Visted = [i]\n    >         checkVis[i] = 5\n    >         toVis = queue.Queue()\n    ```\n\n13. **Adding Adjacent Nodes to Queue**: Add adjacent nodes to the queue.\n    ```python\n    >         for j in range(len(root[i])):\n    >             nex = root[i][j]\n    >             if checkVis[j] != 5 and nex == 1:\n    >                 toVis.put(j)\n    ```\n\n14. **BFS Traversal**: Perform BFS traversal.\n    ```python\n    >         while toVis.empty() == False:\n    >             now = toVis.get()\n    >             if checkVis[now] == 5:\n    >                 continue\n    ```\n\n15. **Mark Node as Visited**: Mark the node as visited and update the visited list.\n    ```python\n    >             Visted.append(now)\n    >             checkVis[now] = 5\n    ```\n\n16. **Adding Adjacent Nodes to Queue**: Add adjacent nodes to the queue.\n    ```python\n    >             for j in range(n):\n    >                 nex = root[now][j]\n    >                 if nex == 1 and checkVis[j] != 5:\n    >                     toVis.put(j)\n    ```\n\n17. **Updating the OK Dictionary**: Update the OK dictionary and mark nodes as processed.\n    ```python\n    >         for j in Visted:\n    >             OK[j] = Visted\n    >             checkOK[j] = 5\n    ```\n\n18. **Calculating and Printing Results**: Calculate the result for each node and print the results.\n    ```python\n    >     ans = []\n    >     for i in range(n):\n    >         num = 0\n    >         for value in OK[i]:\n    >             if root[i][value] == 0:\n    >                 num += 1\n    >         ans.append(num)\n    >     print(\" \".join(map(str, ans)))\n    ```\n\n### Code Coverage:\nGiven the test case input, let's analyze which lines are executed and which are not:\n\n```python\n>

Exception:\nSince `sys.stdin.readline` requires input redirection which cannot be simulated directly in the code, the initial reading of inputs would fail if the input is not provided through standard input redirection, leading to an `EOFError`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe predicted code coverage indicates that all lines of the code have been executed based on the provided test input, and there is no exception raised during the execution. The provided test case ensures that all parts of the code are covered.",

Statements `import queue`, `import sys`, and `import numpy` are covered.\n2. **Input Redirection:** The statement `input = sys.stdin.readline` is always executed.\n3. **Main Function Declaration:** Always executed. `def main():` is covered.\n4. **Input Parsing:** The statement `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` will raise a `ValueError` because `n` is given as 0. This causes the program to terminate early.\n\n### Code Coverage:\nGiven the above test case input and the plan, the execution will terminate early due to the `ValueError` raised during input parsing. Consequently, the steps after this will not be executed.

Statements `import queue`, `import sys`, and `import numpy` will be covered.\n2. **Input Assignment**: Statement `input = sys.stdin.readline` is executed.\n3. **Main Function Declaration**: The `main()` function is declared and will be covered.\n4. **Function Call**: Statement `if __name__==\"__main__\":` and `main()` will be covered as it calls the main function.\n5. **Reading Initial Input**: The initial input `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` will be parsed. Since the input includes vertices and edges, this will be covered.\n6. **Matrix Initialization**: Statements initializing the `root` matrix and setting diagonal elements will be covered.\n7. **Reading Edge Inputs**: Each iteration of the loop `for i in range(m):` will attempt to read edges. Since `m = 3`, the loop will iterate three times to read valid edges:\n   - For the first edge `1 2`\n   - For the second edge `2 3`\n   - For the third edge `3 4`\n   These iterations will be covered.\n8. **Reading Invalid Edge Input**: When the loop attempts to read the fourth edge `1 5`, it will raise a `ValueError` because vertex `5` is out of bounds (greater than `n = 4`). This will cause an exception to be raised and the subsequent code will not be executed.\n\n### Predicted Code Coverage\n\n```python\n> import queue\n> import sys\n> import numpy\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     n,m,k=map(int,input().split())\n>     root=numpy.array([numpy.zeros(n) for i in range(n)])\n>     for i in range(n):\n>         root[i][i]=2\n>     for i in range(m):\n>         a,b=map(int,input().split())\n>         root[a-1][b-1]=1\n>         root[b-1][a-1]=1\n!     for i in range(k):\n!         a,b=map(int,input().split())\n!         root[a-1][b-1]=-100\n!         root[b-1][a-1]=-100\n!     toVis=queue.Queue()\n!

Here\u2019s the step-by-step plan:\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan for Execution:\n\n1. **Import Statements**: Always executed.\n    ```python\n    import queue\n    import sys\n    import numpy\n    ```\n\n2. **Main Function Declaration**: Always executed.\n    ```python\n    def main():\n    ```\n\n3. **Input Reading**: This will be executed, but the provided test case input should be simulated.\n    ```python\n    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n    ```\n\n    With the test case input `4 0 2`, `n = 4`, `m = 0`, `k = 2`.\n\n4. **Root Array Initialization**: Executed.\n    ```python\n    root = numpy.array([numpy.zeros(n) for i in range(n)])\n    ```\n\n5. **Setting Diagonal Elements of Root Array**: Executed.\n    ```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        root[i][i] = 2\n    ```\n\n6. **Populating Root Array Based on Input**: Since `m = 0`, this loop will not be executed.\n    ```python\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        root[a-1][b-1] = 1\n        root[b-1][a-1] = 1\n    ```\n\n7. **Updating Root Array for Penalty Edges**: Executed for `k = 2`.\n    ```python\n    for i in range(k):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        root[a-1][b-1] = -100\n        root[b-1][a-1] = -100\n    ```\n\n    With the test case inputs `1 2` and `3 4`, the root array will be updated accordingly.\n\n8. **Initialization Before BFS Traversal**: Executed.\n    ```python\n    toVis = queue.Queue()\n    Visted = []\n    checkOK = numpy.zeros(n)\n    OK = {}\n    checkVis = numpy.zeros(n)\n    checkVinit = numpy.zeros(n)\n    ```\n\n9. **BFS Traversal for Each Node**: Executed for `n = 4`.\n    ```python\n    for i in range(n):\n        if checkOK[i] == 5:\n            continue\n        checkVis = checkVinit\n        Visted = [i]\n        checkVis[i] = 5\n        toVis = queue.Queue()\n        for j in range(len(root[i])):\n            nex = root[i][j]\n            if checkVis[j] != 5 and nex == 1:\n                toVis.put(j)\n        while toVis.empty() == False:\n            now = toVis.get()\n            if checkVis[now] == 5:\n                continue\n            Visted.append(now)\n            checkVis[now] = 5\n            for j in range(n):\n                nex = root[now][j]\n                if nex == 1 and checkVis[j] != 5:\n                    toVis.put(j)\n        for j in Visted:\n            OK[j] = Visted\n            checkOK[j] = 5\n    ```\n\n    During this traversal, the program will encounter a `KeyError` when trying to access `OK[i]` where `i` is not in the dictionary. This happens in the loop where `checkOK[i]` is checked and `OK[j]` is assigned.\n\n10. **Count Zero Edges and Print Result**: This part will not be executed due to the `KeyError` encountered earlier.\n    ```python\n    ans = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        num = 0\n        for value in OK[i]:\n            if root[i][value] == 0:\n                num += 1\n        ans.append(num)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, ans)))\n    ```\n\n11. **Main Function Invocation**: Always executed.\n    ```python\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n### Predicted Code Coverage:\n\n```python\n> import queue\n> import sys\n> import numpy\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n>     root = numpy.array([numpy.zeros(n) for i in range(n)])\n>     for i in range(n):\n>         root[i][i] = 2\n>     for i in range(m):\n!         a, b = map(int, input().split())\n!         root[a-1][b-1] = 1\n!         root[b-1][a-1] = 1\n>     for i in range(k):\n>         a, b = map(int, input().split())\n>         root[a-1][b-1] = -100\n>         root[b-1][a-1] = -100\n>     toVis = queue.Queue()\n>     Visted = []\n>     checkOK = numpy.zeros(n)\n>     OK = {}\n>     checkVis = numpy.zeros(n)\n>     checkVinit = numpy.zeros(n)\n>     for i in range(n):\n>         if checkOK[i] == 5:\n>             continue\n>         checkVis = checkVinit\n>         Visted = [i]\n>         checkVis[i] = 5\n>         toVis = queue.Queue()\n>         for j in range(len(root[i])):\n>             nex = root[i][j]\n>             if checkVis[j] != 5 and nex == 1:\n>                 toVis.put(j)\n>         while toVis.empty() == False:\n>             now = toVis.get()\n>             if checkVis[now] == 5:\n>                 continue\n>             Visted.append(now)\n>             checkVis[now] = 5\n>             for j in range(n):\n>                 nex = root[now][j]\n>                 if nex == 1 and checkVis[j] != 5:\n>                     toVis.put(j)\n>         for j in Visted:\n>             OK[j] = Visted\n>             checkOK[j] = 5\n!     ans = []\n!     for i in range(n):\n!         num = 0\n!         for value in OK[i]:\n!             if root[i][value] == 0:\n!                 num += 1\n!         ans.append(num)\n!     print(\" \".join(map(str, ans)))\n> if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n>     main()\n```\n\n### Runtime Exception Raised:\n```plaintext\nError: KeyError\n```\n\nThe `KeyError` occurs because the loop tries to access `OK[i]` for an `i` that is not a key in `OK`. This results in the termination of the program before reaching the final part of the code.",

Given the input, it will read `4`, `3`, and `2`.\n5. **Matrix Initialization**:\n    - `root = numpy.array([numpy.zeros(n) for i in range(n)])` initializes the `root` matrix.\n    - The loop `for i in range(n):` and the statement `root[i][i] = 2` set the diagonal elements to 2.\n6. **Reading Edges**:\n    - The loop `for i in range(m):` and the statements inside it read the edges. For the first three edges (`1 2`, `2 3`, `3 4`), the corresponding matrix entries are set to 1.\n    - The statement `root[a-1][b-1] = 1` and `root[b-1][a-1] = 1` are executed for valid `a` and `b`.\n7. **Reading Negative Edges**:\n    - The loop `for i in range(k):` and the statements inside it read the negative edges. For the first edge (`5 6`), since `5 > n`, trying to access `root[4][5]` will raise an `IndexError`.\n8. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and associated logic are not executed because of the exception raised in step 7.\n\n### Code Coverage:\n\n```\n> import queue\n> import sys\n> import numpy\n> input = sys.stdin.readline\n> def main():\n>     n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n>     root = numpy.array([numpy.zeros(n) for i in range(n)])\n>     for i in range(n):\n>         root[i][i] = 2\n>     for i in range(m):\n>         a, b = map(int, input().split())\n>         root[a-1][b-1] = 1\n>         root[b-1][a-1] = 1\n>     for i in range(k):\n>         a, b = map(int, input().split())\n!         root[a-1][b-1] = -100\n!         root[b-1][a-1] = -100\n!     toVis = queue.Queue()\n!
